### santhA recordings
I practiced a few saamans using our santhA recordings. It was a wonderful experience - as if the guru were right here teaching me. This made me very excited - because not only will my apasvaras decrease as a result, it also opened the possibility of recording such santhA-s for all the sAman-s, so that even after I move away, I can use them to continue my practice and master them in due course, before occasionally scheduling an online zoom session with the teacher so that he can test and refine!

One other thing I noted is that the recording of the repetition does not matter so much because one concentrates on reproducing the guru's sound - so there might as well have been an empty gap after a phrase to allow repetition. That said, there is some minor use so that deviations from the recorded repetitions stand out.

Indeed, it also strikes me that after initial few months of in-person lessons to fix and improve one's "singing voice", others can use these santhA recordings to learn these sAman-s at home and please the deva-s agni, soma and indra!
