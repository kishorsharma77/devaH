## प्रवेशः
- "The deva-s started unveiling themselves: the upward blaze of agni in the three stations, the power of vAyu, the all-encompassing indra, the natural conservations of mitra, the natural laws whose violations are punished by varuNa, the exhilaration of knowing the natural law in aryaman, the swift transmission of the maruts, the dissolution of natural bonds through their father, the archer rudra, the light of savitA, the warmth of puShA, distribution of energies through bhaga, the flow of time in viShNu, the Milky way and the earthly flows of sarasvatI, the chemistry of the ashvins, the clear reflection by bR^ihaspati, the revolutions and the cycles of the observable cosmos in soma and tvaShTa with the R^ibhus, the world axis and its precessions in Aja-ekapAd and ahir-budhnya, the origins in aditi and then the mysterious prajApati called ka, and national identity in the 3 goddess ilA, sarasvatI and bhAratI" [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/05/12/fierce-battling/)

## परिचयः
- इन्द्रः! पुरन्दरः!
  - शुष्णः शोषको +अपामावरको ऽहिरूपः। [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/12/28/matters-of-religion-1/)। तस्य हन्ता हीन्द्रः। 
  - वृत्रो हि+ अपामावरको मेघ इति सायणः क्वचित्! तस्य हन्ता वृत्रहा इन्द्रः!
- सोमः। The Indu in the ritual arena is the Ephedra juice but in the celestial realm is actually the moon, the celestial Soma.
- Rbhu-s are analogous to elves.
