## History
### Pre-gunpowder
- "उल्काहस्ता नराः कुर्युः पितॄणां मार्गदर्शनम्". Ulkas were used to show pitRs the way back to pitRloka.
  - pitRloka is known to be an area in the sky (eg: southern ecliptic hemisphere) since vedic times - so showing light high in the air is essential for showing the path.
- ulka-s then indicated burning torches held high up or thrown into the air.
  - Might have looked like Agni Keli/ Fire Fight at the Kateel Durga Parameswari Temple in Mangalore, India, where hundreds of devotees hurl burning palm branches at each other. [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrS2se3hUcU)
  - They crackle and sparkle - hence merit the name crackers.
-  In Telugu states for a kid's first deepavali, elders hold his hand and make him light up the stem a castor plant called dīviṭi. (Even in kannaDa the word dIvaTige is used for mashaal.) It is smashed to ground. 'dubbu dubbu deepavali malli vacche nagula chaviti' is said during that.

### Post-gunpowder
- V. Raghavan, “Festivals, Sports And Pastimes of India”, p. 211: “crackers and rockets were really later substitutes for the ancient ‘Ulkādāna’ of the ‘Pitṛ’s”.
