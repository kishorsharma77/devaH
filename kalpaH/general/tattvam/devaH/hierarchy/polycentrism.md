title: Polycentrism
---

Polycentrism is one way the strong harmony among the deva-s manifests itself. 

## Definition
- "Polytheism can be understood in terms of all Gods being inherent in *each* God, rather than all Gods being inherent in *one* God. Some authors use the term "polycentric polytheism" to refer to this understanding." - Edward Butler
- Polycentrism: "Many worshipers may worship a single God and regard the other Gods in the field as somehow dependent upon or aspects of their chosen deity." \[[EB](https://endymions-bower.dreamwidth.org/56736.html)\]
- In its strongest ideal never-realized form, _any_ deity (not just a limited set) can be considered as "center".

## Provenance
- At a population level, that there is a "multiplicity of positive existential commitments" regarding the supreme deity is an empirical fact beyond dispute. Eg. Hinduism.
- At an individual level, [henotheism](../../labeling/henotheism/) may be observed. This can be explained by polycentrism.
- Polycentrism can even exist \*within\* a deity due to it residing in multiple shrines - one may find the universe in one's clan deity (an individuation of the more abstract deva residing in a particular shrine) \[[KV](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2017/12/16/polycentrism-the-clan-deity-case/)\] .
    - "It's really a very important observation, because it shows that polycentricity is a primary feature of polytheism, from the ground up, so to speak, and not the result of the development of some kind of sophisticated, elite theology. Hence the paradigm case of polycentricity is the universal adequacy of a localized deity, not the universality of a nationwide cult." \[[EB](https://twitter.com/EPButler/status/942142795699105792)\]

### Polycentrism with full mutual metaphysical acceptance
Different people may be centered on different such Gods (oft from a limited set), with mutual acceptance of such centerings showing the following traits:

- It is of the "my mother is the best mother in the world" kind.
- From a metaphysical perspective, there is no doubt that other centers than one's own can fully play the role of adoration "center".

Examples:
  - "iShTa-devatA" (as a stepping stone towards attributeless, formless, unfathomable brahman) concept among advaita-smArta hindu-s

### Polycentrism without full mutual metaphysical acceptance
- Example: the vaiShNava-s, shaiva-s etc.. can easily accord polycentrism (in the overall hindu population) hermeneutical significance (ie - one can reasonably imagine x,y or z is supreme based on texts). But full metaphyiscal agreement (where it concerns the nature of supreme God) would imply watering down their own philosophies.

## Polycentric social field
Definition: Mutual acknowledgement of certain multiple Gods (whatever the center) and intimate entanglement between their lores and cults defines a polycentric social field.

- Examples:
    - Acknowledgement of multiple deities who can each be treated as the center is clear in the vedic lore. \[[MT](http://indiafacts.org/polycentrism-many-one-problem-roots-yoga/#.VF0zlBFGjUZ)\]
    - "Of a dramatist-philosopher-logician from 10th century, jayanta bhaTTa whose work serves as a prototype for the religion/counter-religion distinction and also alludes to the 'tacit recognition' we speak of..."
    - "nAvalar, a devout and orthodox shaiva teacher from shrI lanka who had to contend with western missionaries attacking shaivam. In a certain polemical treatise, he raises a question often asked by the Padres  "Why do you attack only us when there are others within your own religion who believe in gods other than shiva (viSNu, etc) as supreme?" nAvalar proceeds to answer along the lines that these deities are recognized by his own deity & therefore worshiping them is no fault while the "god" of the padres is not recognized; again, alluding to the 'tacit recognition' idea."

## Importance of the polycentric discourse:
- "Where the polycentric polytheistic field is explicitly articulated as such, we have the perfection of a philosophical discourse about religion, but this perfection is not a condition for the existence of polytheism as such, or for its essential polycentricity." \[[EB](https://endymions-bower.dreamwidth.org/56736.html)\]
- "It is just that our thinkers & leaders are yet to fully grapple with this depth of discourse. Many of them would not be able to formulate a decent explanation of why this tacit recognition is more pronounced than one would give credit for & is indeed adequate." \[[EB](https://endymions-bower.dreamwidth.org/56736.html)\]
