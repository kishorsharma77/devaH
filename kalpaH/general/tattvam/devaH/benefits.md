## Summary
na vā are devānāṃ kāmāya devāḥ priyā bhavanti  
ātmanastu kāmāya devāḥ priyā bhavanti |  
na vā are vedānāṃ kāmāya vedāḥ priyā bhavanti  
ātmanastu kāmāya vedāḥ priyā bhavanti |  
(Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.6)  

Devās are loved, not for their sake,  
but for the sake of the Self  
Vedas are loved, not for their sake,  
but for the sake of the Self  


- A poetic imaginative way of thinking is involved in abstracting and shaping thought in terms of devatA-s, mantra-s, nyAsa-s, yajJNa-s and [stories](../myth/).
- deva-s are very powerful forces in their capacity to help us intellectually and emotionally distinguish the noble from the ignoble (the emotional cultivation being the dominant contribution). It helps us develop positive qualities and good aspirations in a very deliberate, yet very enjoyable way. As an example, consider the following mundane example: "For a straight back, imagine your head hangs from a thread (ballerinas do)."
- Among other things, this reverence of awesome nature and upholders of dharma engenders reverence for nature, and renews of faith in the grandest ideals of this dharma.
- It may even improve our performance at various tasks.
    - Example: The ancestor effect: Thinking about our genetic origin enhances intellectual performance (article [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.778/abstract))
- Not answering prayer stuff (considered in a separate subsection).
    - Personal note: - To me, the influence of the deva-s is limited to being the influence of concepts, symbols and perception on minds (and ultimately behavior) - yet what satisfying influence that can be!

## Answering prayers, or not.

- The greatest value of deva-s is in the realm of feelings and sentiment, as explained elsewhere. Answering material requests (like some ATM) is secondary.
- Importantly, the deva-s mostly do not alter or abort the laws of the universe (which makes sense because they are themselves part of Rta framework). As GA said: "Too many people think tantra is about churning out supernatural effects that defy the operating laws of the universe at an extremely visible, public level. NO. Such effects are known & do exist, albeit at a private level.".
- An illustrative example: From bhAgavata-purANa 10.24, the central message of kRShNa is "Indra does not cause rains; it is karma and natural processes. You ought to adore karma instead."
    - He then asks the cowherds to adore the hillock and cattle. This, considering the preceding message, is but symbolic and about as meaningful emotionally (to the cowherds) as appeasing the clouds.
    - So, at best, the govardhana incident can be considered an argument against deities that answer to material requests of humans; while endorsing the continuation of pUja as an emotional and symbolic act.

## Deva-bhakta relationship
We emphasize that to a practicing hindu, they are not remotely abstract entities like Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Juno are to (sadly) Christianized Italians; rather they are alive and immediate in the artistic experience that is the hindu way of thought. One propitiates them regularly with various rituals (In fact, I am more observant than most) as if they were wilful entities, and questions about their imaginary nature never enter my mind when involved with hindu rituals. It is a primeval way of looking at nature and life. IshAna still lives in our rage, Indra in our stength, prithivI/ Earth in our body, herbs in our hair, sarasvatI on the tip of my tongue, agni in my speech and so on. (A lament on the fools that chose to leave this for the monotony and paleness of Abrahamisms [is here](http://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/the-fools-that-converted/).)
