ātmanastu kāmāya devāḥ priyā bhavanti |  
na vā are vedānāṃ kāmāya vedāḥ priyā bhavanti  
ātmanastu kāmāya vedāḥ priyā bhavanti |  
(Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.6)  

Devās are loved, not for their sake,  
but for the sake of the Self  
Vedas are loved, not for their sake,  
but for the sake of the Self  


- A poetic imaginative way of thinking is involved in abstracting and shaping thought in terms of devatA-s, mantra-s, nyAsa-s, yajJNa-s and [stories](../myth/).
- deva-s are very powerful forces in their capacity to help us intellectually and emotionally distinguish the noble from the ignoble (the emotional cultivation being the dominant contribution). It helps us develop positive qualities and good aspirations in a very deliberate, yet very enjoyable way. As an example, consider the following mundane example: "For a straight back, imagine your head hangs from a thread (ballerinas do)."
- Among other things, this reverence of awesome nature and upholders of dharma engenders reverence for nature, and renews of faith in the grandest ideals of this dharma.
- It may even improve our performance at various tasks.
    - Example: The ancestor effect: Thinking about our genetic origin enhances intellectual performance (article [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.778/abstract))
- Not answering prayer stuff (considered in a separate subsection).
    - Personal note: - To me, the influence of the deva-s is limited to being the influence of concepts, symbols and perception on minds (and ultimately behavior) - yet what satisfying influence that can be!

## Answering prayers, or not.

- The greatest value of deva-s is in the realm of feelings and sentiment, as explained elsewhere. Answering material requests (like some ATM) is secondary.
- Importantly, the deva-s mostly do not alter or abort the laws of the universe (which makes sense because they are themselves part of Rta framework). As GA said: "Too many people think tantra is about churning out supernatural effects that defy the operating laws of the universe at an extremely visible, public level. NO. Such effects are known & do exist, albeit at a private level.".
- An illustrative example: From bhAgavata-purANa 10.24, the central message of kRShNa is "Indra does not cause rains; it is karma and natural processes. You ought to adore karma instead."
    - He then asks the cowherds to adore the hillock and cattle. This, considering the preceding message, is but symbolic and about as meaningful emotionally (to the cowherds) as appeasing the clouds.
    - So, at best, the govardhana incident can be considered an argument against deities that answer to material requests of humans; while endorsing the continuation of pUja as an emotional and symbolic act.


## Picking targets of adoration
### One vs many
Pros and cons in either case:
- Adoring the many:
  - More accommodating of other cults
  - Better explanation of vagaries of nature:
      - Illustration from Illiad, where the devatAs themselves take sides in desperate battles on behalf of their human kin! That this happens is telling. Jupiter clearly reigns as the first among equals, rather than as puppet-master.
- Focusing on the one supreme:
    - There is an essential regularity in the universe. There is the question of the ultimate cause.
    - But it can be more monotonous.

### dharma subversion danger
- शास्त्रेषु विहिता एव स्युः पूजनीया देवता इति न। किन्तु, शास्त्रेतर-दैवतेषु पूजायोग्यता चिन्तनीयैव।
- तत्राऽपि मानुषाणाम् आधुनिकानाम्। यथोन्मत्तानाम् अब्राह्म\-मूलानां म्लेच्छानां पूज्यो राक्षसो न पूजामर्हत्य् आर्याणाम्, यथा च हिरण्यकशिपुर् नार्हत् परमपूजां पितृत्वेन प्रह्लादपूजापात्रञ्चेदपि तथैव सायिम्लेच्छस्यपूजायाम् अस्त्येवापत्तिः। किन्नाम \- सा पूजा ऽऽर्य-म्लेच्छ-भेद-भावनां निवारयति, कपटेन वैदिकता+उन्मादयोस् साम-रस्यं सम्पादयति जन-मनस्स्व् इत्य् अस्मासु जनयेद् भीतिम् महतीम् राष्ट्र-धर्म-हितकाङ्क्षिषु। यथा शबरीमल-यात्रायां वावर-पूजाम् अन्यथा व्याख्यान्त एवम् एव कुर्वन्तो दृश्यन्ते।
- अत्र देहस्य "immune system" निदर्शनरूपेण गृह्यताम्। AIDS-रोग-ग्रस्थानां देहेषु निजपरतत्त्वभेदशक्तिर् भवति नष्टा। ओषध्यभावे शीघ्रमेव परजीवाणुभिर् आक्रान्तास् तद्देहा मिर्यन्ते।
