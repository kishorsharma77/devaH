The Gods are multiple (whether or not they arose from a single being before time). This is clear from the experience they granted to our ancestors the Arya-s - with different names, lores and rituals. There is no good reason to reduce them to "angels" or "demigods" or "facets" of the same entity - it suffices to acknowledge their [generality](../generality) and the provisional nature of their [myths](../myth). They may even be innumerable - with more Gods revealing themselves to us under changing spatio-temporal and social circumstances.

## Gods accross cultures and locations
Indra of the Indo-Arya-s is not necessarily the same as Zeus of the Greeks or Jupiter of the Romans - they may well have been offspring of the same God adored by our common ancestors. Just because two doctor brothers appear similar, it does not follow that they are the same. The same applies to "same" Gods at different locations \[example - [KV](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2017/12/16/polycentrism-the-clan-deity-case/)\].

That said, it is valid to approach new God shrines with reference to our experience with previous Gods. It is certainly possible for multiple Gods to be accessible from the very same icon/ portal - even if via the itermediary (mantresha) associated with the particular icon/ shrine.
