These entities, unlike the general Gods, are very limited in their activity. 

## Deities strongly bound to bodies (abhimAnI-devatA-s)
- A [vaidika view](https://youtu.be/DUsZ_5A7-Ho?list=PLhPjckGlZ7rQFXvhumWnIctUgARdPYayL&t=228) \[[YT](https://youtu.be/DUsZ_5A7-Ho?list=PLhPjckGlZ7rQFXvhumWnIctUgARdPYayL&t=228)\] is that certain devatA-s are conscious and willful entities attached to every single living or non-living substance. Example: one addressses the twig to be broken, the grass to be cut, the scythe to be used, the ladle etc..

## shaiva-siddhAnta

> There are empowered souls on the path to mokSha that are delegated various cosmological tasks (e.g., the vidyeshvara-s).
>
> Then there are those who have attained mokSha/shivatvam who may no longer do any work since they won’t do anything impelled by desire. Do they then do anything spontaneously? I’m not sure. They are all-pervasive like *the* Śiva & also bear all of existence within themselves.
