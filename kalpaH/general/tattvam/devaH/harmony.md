title = "Harmony"
+++

- Irrespective of specifics of hierarchy claims, all major hindu traditions assume great harmony among all the deva-s; and the vedic tradition necessarily involves adoring multiple deva-s in the prescribed rituals - no sectarian ifs and buts.
- Key thing is cognizance of harmony among the deva-s - hierarchy or respect for other possible hierarchies is hair-splitting which mostly only serves polemics.
- The hard "good vs evil" dichotomy is absent in the hindu milieu, as described [here](../non-evil/). Rather, there is the "higher" vs "lower" gradation.

## Harmony despite conflicting mythic claims to supremeness.
- If subrahmaNya is subordinate to shiva or indra or if durgA is created by other deities, it is because he/ she consents to it. So, this willing subordination in a particular context does not necessarily imply lower power - just condescension.
- Alternatively, the basic essence of other Gods is present in every God - there is just a difference in emphasis. (See [polycentrism](polycentrism/))
- Ideas such as moha-shAstra etc..
    - arthavAda and nahi-nindA-nyAya (see [authority-contets](authority-contets/))
    - The nature of myth. Even though myths meant to help devotional practice and adoration centered on a certain deity show conflicts and even denigration of deities - they are not to be taken literally.

## Expressions of harmony
### Identification with other deities

#### Isis case
> Lo, I am with you, Lucius, moved by your prayers, I who am the mother of the universe, the mistress of all the elements, the first offspring of time, the highest of deities, the queen of the dead, foremost of heavenly beings, the single form that fuses all gods and goddesses; I who order by my will the starry heights of heaven, the health giving breezes of the sea, and the awul silences of those in the underworld: my single godhead is adored by the whole world in varied forms, in differing rites and with many diverse names.

> Thus the Phyrgians ... call me Pessinuntia ...; the Athenians ... call me Cecropeian Minerva; the Cyprians ... call me Paphian Venus, the ... Cretans Dictynna, the ... Sicilians Ortygian Proserpinel to the Eleusinians I am Ceres..., to others Juno, to others Bellona and Hecate and Rhamnusia. But the Ethiopians ... together with the Africans and Egyptians who excel by having my original doctrine honor me with my distinctive rites and give me my true name of Queen Isis.
