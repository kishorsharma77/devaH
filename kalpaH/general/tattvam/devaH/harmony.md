title = "Harmony"
+++

## Intro
- Key thing is cognizance of harmony among the deva-s - hierarchy or respect for other possible hierarchies is hair-splitting which mostly only serves polemics.
- The hard "good vs evil" dichotomy is absent in the hindu milieu, as described [here](../non-evil/). Rather, there is the "higher" vs "lower" gradation.

## Reconciling mythic superiority claims
- If subrahmaNya is subordinate to shiva or indra or if durgA is created by other deities, it is because he/ she consents to it (in the context of the particular myth). So, this willing subordination in a particular context does not necessarily imply lower power - just condescension.
- Ideas such as moha-shAstra, lower-vidyA etc.. help reconciliation.
    - arthavAda and nahi-nindA-nyAya
    - The nature of myth. Even though myths meant to help devotional practice and adoration centered on a certain deity show conflicts and even denigration of deities - they are not to be taken literally.
- The idea of [generality](../generality) implies that the "essence or emphasis" of God A is anyway in God B - so praise of God A is indirect praise for even God B.

### Meaning as cult-competition
Myths / imagery of one deity killing or trampling other may be understood as serving cult competition. This does not affect factual harmony amongst the Gods when understood as:

- simple untrue propaganda
- a means of using one deity in a conflict with a rival cult aided by a different deity - rather than as actual direct conflict between the deities themselves. The deities themselves could be like two friends betting against each other in a cock-fight.

## Expressions of harmony
- Irrespective of specifics of hierarchy claims, all major hindu mythic traditions pronounce great harmony among all the deva-s
- the vedic tradition necessarily involves adoring multiple deva-s in the prescribed rituals - no sectarian ifs and buts.

### Identification with other deities
#### Isis case
> Lo, I am with you, Lucius, moved by your prayers, I who am the mother of the universe, the mistress of all the elements, the first offspring of time, the highest of deities, the queen of the dead, foremost of heavenly beings, the single form that fuses all gods and goddesses; I who order by my will the starry heights of heaven, the health giving breezes of the sea, and the awul silences of those in the underworld: my single godhead is adored by the whole world in varied forms, in differing rites and with many diverse names.
>
> Thus the Phyrgians ... call me Pessinuntia ...; the Athenians ... call me Cecropeian Minerva; the Cyprians ... call me Paphian Venus, the ... Cretans Dictynna, the ... Sicilians Ortygian Proserpinel to the Eleusinians I am Ceres..., to others Juno, to others Bellona and Hecate and Rhamnusia. But the Ethiopians ... together with the Africans and Egyptians who excel by having my original doctrine honor me with my distinctive rites and give me my true name of Queen Isis.
