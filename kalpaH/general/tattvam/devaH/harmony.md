title = "Harmony"
+++

- Irrespective of specifics of hierarchy claims, all major hindu traditions assume great harmony among all the deva-s; and the vedic tradition necessarily involves adoring multiple deva-s in the prescribed rituals - no sectarian ifs and buts.
- Key thing is cognizance of harmony among the deva-s - hierarchy or respect for other possible hierarchies is hair-splitting which mostly only serves polemics.
- The hard "good vs evil" dichotomy is absent in the hindu milieu, as described [here](../non-evil/). Rather, there is the "higher" vs "lower" gradation.

## Harmony despite conflicting mythic claims to supremeness.
- If subrahmaNya is subordinate to shiva or indra or if durgA is created by other deities, it is because he/ she consents to it. So, this willing subordination in a particular context does not necessarily imply lower power - just condescension.
- Alternatively, the basic essence of other Gods is present in every God - there is just a difference in emphasis. (See [polycentrism](polycentrism/))
- Ideas such as moha-shAstra etc..
    - arthavAda and nahi-nindA-nyAya (see [authority-contets](authority-contets/))
    - The nature of myth. Even though myths meant to help devotional practice and adoration centered on a certain deity show conflicts and even denigration of deities - they are not to be taken literally.
