      <description>The conflict between Good (eg. dharma) and Evil (eg. counter religions) is endless.
 Via MT
One major difference between the Abrahamistic counter-religions of the Messianic variety and the Indo-European religions is the single endpoint utopianism preached by the former. This is the driving force behind its secular mutations, including that in whose grip the modern Occident is currently convulsing.
In contrast, at least since the break up between us and our Iranian cousins (of the Zoroastrian flavor) both sides had ingrained in them the concept of the eternal or repeated episodic struggle of the deva-s and asura-s.</description>

      <description>Intro Was there a creation? Then, there is the question of the creator - was it intelligent? Unlike abrahamisms which consider it as an unquestionable axiom, the Hindu vaidika tradition considers it requiring support from argument and speculation.
Varied views:
 kumArIla-bhaTTa the mImAMsaka rejects the notion of a creator or creation as implausible and hard to establish (eng_gj, sa_kb). The Samkhyakarika accepts the notion of higher selves or perfected beings but rejects the notion of God.</description>

      <description>Magic and supernatural phenomena  Supernatural claims were used to motivate and preserve &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; behavior (see deities, karma and rituals) - just as one does in good legends and drama. They can, of course, be accepted in that sense from an aesthetic standpoint. It was also supposed that one could attain one&amp;rsquo;s goals (bringing rain, death of enemies, wealth, poetic abilities, freedom from debt, recovery of health etc..) through various rituals (chanting a mantra or a stotra, adoring a deity in certain ways).</description>

      <description>सत् We exist.  &amp;ldquo;First: can we question our own existence? If yes, even such questions will be the product of our own existence.&amp;rdquo; SG_IF15  चित् We are aware, to some extant at least. And we may even like it. This is because we are conscious.
 Consciousness is fundamental constituent of the universe, more fundamental than time, space, matter and energy. We suppose this given the &amp;ldquo;hard problem of consciousness&amp;rdquo;.</description>
