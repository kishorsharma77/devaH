## Vedic Human Sacrifice
- puruSha-medha
    - "Srauta sutras and even brahmanas mention that men are not killed in purushamedha"\[[TW17](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/849800893201612800)\]
    - "But maybe in pre samhita yajnas and para-vaidika traditions may have continued it".
        - "puruSha-medha rite the rival king was captured and brought as a prisoner by the sacrificing king. The rite lasted a whole year. At the end of it he was smothered and sacrificed with the deployment of the puruSha sUkta. Along with him, his animals may also be sacrificed and immolated as offerings." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/08/11/vedic-human-sacrifice/)\].
- Collection of a skull for chayana during a yAga, described [here](../violence/), could involve killing.
- (Almost) sacrifice of Śunaśśepha by ambarISha.
- shunaskarNa+agniShToma where the yajamAna/patnI sacrifice themselves
