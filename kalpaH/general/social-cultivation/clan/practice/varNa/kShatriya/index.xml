      <description>Motivation  &amp;ldquo;Gupte (1919, pp. 6-7) reports that the question of the Vedic rites for the CKPs began with Balāji Avaji&amp;rsquo;s desire to have the upanayana ceremony performed for his elder son in Sake 1591 (1669AD). However, Shivāji&amp;rsquo;s Brahmin ministers Moropant Pingle and Raghunathpant Amātya opposed this notion. Shivāji then sent this dispute to Anantadeva and Gāgābhaṭṭa in Banaras.&amp;rdquo;  Later reignition  &amp;ldquo;Nāyak (1877) provides important local narratives explaining some of the reasons why the fights between the Prabhus (CKP as well as Pathare/Pattanes) and the Chitpavan Brahmins may have reignited in the region of Konkan in the middle of the 18th century.</description>

      <description>In the place of kShatriya-s, for example, we had Samanta Kshatriya-s in keraLa ( W, ie. shUdra-s who function like kShatriya-s for most practical, if not ceremonial, purposes ). In traditional texts and treatises on Kerala such as the Kerala Mahatmayam and Keralolpathi the nair rulers are referred to as &amp;ldquo;sAmanta kShatriyas&amp;rdquo; (Kshatriyas only in function, not jAti). This was because swaroopams/royal families had political and social power but were Kshatriya only in profession and were not recognized as Kshatriya within the Vedic tradition per se.</description>

      <description>Early hindu influence  Atombapu Sharma, 20th century sanskritist, argues that through the pu+++(=ancestor)+++ya+++(=agreement)+++-s tells us the religio-cultural rudiments of Hinduism in Manipur from the first century B.C. and more particularly during the reign of king Apanba. He notes that royal family was influenced by Vishnu swami sect of vaisnavism from an early date. By 8th century AD, archaeological evidences firmly support entry of Hinduism  Social structure  &amp;ldquo;According to the royal chronicle, Cheitharol Kumbaba, the Manipuri valley was ruled by 9 different clans or tribes, which later merged into seven.</description>

      <description>Background See theory page.
Support  &amp;ldquo;It would appear that Gāgābhaṭṭa accepted the first argument about the seed-presence of the Kṣatriyas in the Kali age, and tried to remedy their loss of dharma with purificatory vrātya-stoma rite. &amp;hellip; The opinion of Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭa&amp;rsquo;s Dharmapravr̥tti is echoed verbatim by Anantadeva in his Samskāra-kaustubha (pp. 114-115, litho graphic edition, Bombay, 1861). Anantadeva was a close associate of Gāgābhaṭṭa in making decisions regarding the CKPs and Kṣatriyas.</description>

      <description>Before the muslim invasion, the kShatriya varNa was widespread - even in south India. vIra ballALa the hoysala, famously told malik kafur that he is willing to give up everything except his sacred thread. chulavamsha clearly describes the buddhist sinhalese king parAkrama bAhu of lanka undergoing upanayanam (MT, GB). the kadamba-s of karNATaka were famously brAhmaNa-s converted to kShatriya-s. Many dynasties of India, including south Indian ones such as chAlukya, pANDya and choLa kings conducted vedic yAga-s allowed for kShatriya-s such as rAjasUya and ashvamedha.</description>

      <description>Motivation  &amp;ldquo;The CKP dispute at Shivāji&amp;rsquo;s court appears to have arisen before the dispute regarding Shivāji&amp;rsquo;s own eligibility for royal coronation.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;It was Balāji Avaji Chitnis,[4] a CKP, who assisted Shivāji&amp;rsquo;s search for his Rajput Kṣatriya roots by sending investigators to the north (cf. Shejwalkar 1964: 477; Sriśivadigvijaya, pp. 249 ff.), and, according to the Chitnis-Bakhar, it was Balāji Avaji who suggested to Shivāji that he invite Gāgābhaṭṭa in connection with the coronation.</description>

      <description>Pre-hindu structure jAti-s and varNa-s  The Tai Ahoms royalty under Sukaphaa (1228–1268) came in with their own nobility and priestly class who were also of divine origin. Royal clans were barred from being ministers, who were themselves dominated by specific noble clans (Burhagohain, Borgohain, Borpatrogohain, Borbarua and Borphukan). &amp;ldquo;Ahom clans, called phoids, formed socio-political entities. At the time of ingress into Assam, or soon thereafter, there were seven important clans, called Satghariya Ahoms (Ahoms of the Seven Houses).</description>

      <description>Intro  &amp;ldquo;from the 1931 census, the Vanniyars in the 1980s constituted around 10 per cent of the population of Tamil Nadu, being particularly prevalent in the northernmost districts of Chingelput, North Arcot, South Arcot and Salem, where they formed around 25 per cent of the population.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;most Vanniyars are agricultural labourers but they are increasingly benefiting from political influence and organisation and they now own 50 per cent of the lands of the traditional landowners.</description>
