      <description>He was encouraged to serve a dvija for livelihood; but this was not a compulsion.  Attenuation: There was always the widely used āpad-dharma loophole that enabled him to do something else (essentially the occupation of a vaiśya or a kṣatriya) if he thought that the former occupation cannot meet his needs, or if the country was in disarray.   A śūdra was dissuaded from becoming the ruler of a kingdom, though broad sections of the śūdra society were considered to have fallen from kṣatriya status.</description>

      <description>Intro  Fewer ritual demands. Almost no food or drink restrictions. No gotra/ pravara based marriage restrictions, since in most cases they wouldn’t even be known. Pursuit of nearly any occupation (we’ll dwell on the few restrictions later). Little or no penance for deviating from the śāstra.  In contrast, dvija-s (especially brāhmaṇa-s) had a great many restrictions placed on them with regard to rituals, daily practice (ācāra), livelihood, education and food.</description>

      <description>Legal disabilities  Higher punishment for certain offences.  For example: Adultry with a dvija woman, slander against a dvija. Attenuation: In several cases, a person of a higher varṇa was subject to greater prāyaścitta and daṇḍa. For example, Manu and Gautama require that a brāhmaṇa, a kṣatriya and a vaishya would respectively be fined eight, four and two times more respectively than a śūdra. Kātyāyana and Vyāsa make this principle a general rule for all offences.</description>
