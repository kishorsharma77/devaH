## परिचयः
It is a very complicated yāga, extending over two years and comprising a number of istis and Soma sacrifices. It can be performed only by kings or emperors as it involves & very heavy fee of 2,40,000 cows to the priests! The abhisecanīya rite involving abhiseka (sprinkling of sacred water) of the royal sacrificer is considered to be its core.
