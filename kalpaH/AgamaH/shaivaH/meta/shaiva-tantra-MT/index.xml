Diversity and syncretism in the bhairava or dakShiNa srotas
The bhairava-srotas of the shaiva mantramArga was clearly one of the most speciose branches of the shaiva-shAsana. From the ancestral bhairava-srotas base that itself most probably arose from the kApAlika-oriented streams of the underlying shaiva atimArga the system spawned several distinctive branches: 1) An early branch was the dakShiNashaiva stream centered around the worship of svachChanda bhairava; 2) the system of kapAlIsha bhairava mainly taught in the archaic brahma-yAmala (distinct from the later brahma yAmala of the drAviDa country).</description>

tryambakaṃ yajāmahe sugandhiṃ puṣṭi vardhanam
urvārukam iva bandhanān mṛtyor mukṣīya māmṛtāt
The netra tantra commented upon by the famous kShema-rAja, student of abhinava-gupta, is of some what later origin amongst the shaiva tantras. It is not listed as a primary text in any of the five srotas of the tantric shaiva mArga in support of this contention. However, it was definitely considered cannonical by the start of the syncretic trika period.</description>

The Shunga coins: The late Maurya and Shunga period has the square coins of the Ujjain series bearing the image of kumAra. They installed some idols of kumAra in Mathura (175-50 BC).
The Shakas: The Shaka king Ayalisha (Azilises-I) has kumAra on his coin. Another Indianized Shaka mentions construction of a well in the name of skanda. The exact date of this inscription is unclear: mentioned as year 201 in some era.</description>

I have yarned a lot on this topic from different angles: 1) The shaivas: the pAshupata-s
3) dvijas and non-dvijas in the shaiva cults 2) The kAlAmukhas-I 4) kAlAmukhas-II
But I was brought back to it because ST happened to introduce me to a confused brahmin woman who declared that her Dravidian guru had told her that the siddhanta shaivas had dispensed with the “brahminical strictures” and made their mata “more accessible” to all.</description>

An important, but neglected aspect of the history of India before the cataclysmic Islamic interruption, was the role played by the mantra-mArga siddhAnta shaiva-s in the unification of the country. We had earlier spoken of our historical clansman, the great varmashiva of vodAmayUtA, who converted to this lineage of shaiva-s and had considerable influence with the royal patron of his age. But this just one point in the broader scheme of things.</description>

The early evolution of the shaiva fold is a topic of tremendous interest (I am only grazing the surface with regards to a few points here. One may see some other notes on this topic elsewhere on this site). We obviously have no strong traces of its para-vedic elements. But there are several texts that pertain to the branching point of shaiva from within the old vedic tradition.</description>
