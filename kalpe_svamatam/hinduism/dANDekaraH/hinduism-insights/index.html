be specially witended to nor a particular problem to be deliberately pondered over He views life as an integrated whole and its various aspects as being intrinsically interdependent This may account for there being no word in Sanskrit to denote religion as it is popularly understood The word dl arma, which is usually employed as a synonym for religion, has a far wider connotation Broadly speaking dharma implies the whole compler of theories and prectices relating to the actualities and aspriations of the mate rial and spiritual life of the individual and the society Dharma, to a Hindu, is, accordingly, co extensive with life it may be said to signify the entire way of life, which, however, is not neces sarily and in all respects identical in the case of all those who call themselves Hindus
Hinduism is, in a sense, an ethnic religion It was not reveal. ed to a prophet and then either propagated among or imposed upon the people The Hindus are verily born and grow in Hin duism and this condition of birth is so compulsive that many petsons who are born of Hindu parents have generally to con form to Hinduism though they may not believe in many of its doctrines and practices It has now become almost a truism to say that Hinduism defies all attempts at definition One can hardly assert that a person is entitled to be called a Hindu only if he believes in certain doctrines and follows certain practices or that he forseits his claim to be called a Hindu if he does not believe in certain doctrires and does not follow certain practices
Attempts have no doubt been made, from time to time, to lay down some criteria of Hinduism Belief in the absolute validity of the Veda is, for instance, often mentioned as a distinc tive attribute of a Hindu Actually, however one can be a good and devout Hindu without having to profess such a belief The various schools of Tantrism may be referred to as an instance in point Morcover such a definition ultimately proves to be singu farly vague and nebulous For, the Veda, as we know it, being a collection of essentially heterogeneous and in some cases, even self-contradictory texts one would, indeed, find it difficult to accept the whole of it as being equally valid and binding One

to a vanety of interpretations, no one of which can be said to be invested with absolute authonty Obsersance of caste-rules is certainly a score potent criterion It is neither the disasowal of any particular doctrine nor the devzation from any particular religious practice that has been regarded as a serious lapse on the part of a Hiddo it is rather the non-conformity to the aste-rules which has been regarded as such But even this latter may entail the loss of one s caste-ratus, it does not necessarily entail the loss of bis Hindu religion It may also be pointed out that caste rules are scripturally and conventonally behered to be non ope rative in respect of certain classes of Hindos, such as ascetics and sanm ăsirs Strictly speaking, Hinduism 25 a religion must deeds be distinguisbed from Hinduism as a social organization In this connection, it is significant that in recent times, responsible Hindu thinkers, who are leer on the presensation and promotion of Hinduism as religion, regard caste-system as a veritable corse and openly advocate its abolition Incidentally, it may also be noted that conditions of modero Ife have actually tended to re move the caste-bamers among the Hindus to a large extent Thus, observance of traditional caste-rules cannot be any longer regarded as a universalls vald critenop of Hmdoism The belief
the sanctity of the con and the Brāhmana is too superficial a feature to be considered seriously in this context One cannot also speak of any sacraments being obligatory to all the Hindus Doctrines regarding Zrman karma samsārd, and molsa may per haps be regarded as atiomatic in many schools of Hindu philo sophy, but they are by no means either upisersal or essential so far as Hindu religion 15 concerned For, a person can claim to be a good Hindu without believing in any or all of these doctrines, while a person is not entitled to be called a Hindu only because he accepts any or all of these doctrines
The word “Hindu &ldquo;, it must be remembered, is of a foreign origin It is also of a fairly fate origin Actually, most of what
Vaucta-Lp I 15

is usually understood by the term &quot; Hinduism&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hindu reli gion&rdquo; had been in existence since very much long before that term came into vogue Indeed, the term “Hinduism&quot; came to acquire its specific and complex socio-religious significance only in comparatively recent times Originally, the term “Hindu&quot; seems to have had a purely geographical connotation The people who lived on the other side (that is, on the eastern side ) of the river Indus were loosely called Hindus And, even after that name had, as it were, become naturalised, it was for a long time understood in a more or less negative sense Whoever was born in India and was not a Muslim or a Christian or a Parsi, etc , was called a Hindu Obviously, such a negative description can hardly serve our present purpose It is sometimes suggested that the term “Hindu &quot; is an essentially juridical term, and that a Huodu may be most conveniently defined as a person to whom the Hindu law becomes applicable in the law courts of India But this would amount to arguing 10 a circle, for, Hindu law itself cannot be defined except as the law which is generally made appii cable to the Hindus Moreover, the Hindu law does not become applicable to all the Hindus in the same manner and to the same extent Conversely, it is seen that all those who are today governed by the Hindu law do not necessarily profess Hindu religion Such, for instance, are the Sikhs, the Jainas, and the Buddhists The relationship between Hinduism and the Hindu law is by no means comparable with that between Islam and the Muslim civil law
Hinduism cannot thus be said to be amenable to any theo logical definition or sociological test or juridical characterisation One has, therefore, inevitably to fall back upon the very simple definition namely, that a Hindu is one who is born of Hindu parents and who has not openly abjured Hinduism This defini fion also, no doubt involves the defect of petitio principu, but, in view of the great antiquity of Hinduism, that defect may be treates as more upruent har. 9221 22 may not te legarútá as seriously yitinting that definition However, the real difficulty here would be in respect of recent converts to Hindu religion

By the very nature of its origin and youth, Hinduism has been exceedingly tolerant - tolerant towards other religions and tolerant towards itself It cannot, however, be said that this to leracce has always represented a sublimation of religious feelings or that it has, in every case, ben deliberate and discriminating, But Hinduisto has by and large, always tended to incorporate and assimilate rather than to choose and eliminate Hinduism is also a remarkably free religion &ndash;a rebgion which is cofranelled by any fixed creeds, dogmas, or rituals In the course of its long history, it has manifested a vaique capacity for almost infinite expansion One of its basic assumptions seems to bare been that, thougb relgious practices and beliefs were bound to change according to different times and different curces, they could all be comprehended mithin a larger Unuty Accordingly, Hiodaism has always been variable, elastic, and receptie
Hinduism is essentially dynamic Unlike many religions, which are prophetic or creedal and which, therefore, necessarily tend to remain static it has exhibited, throughout history, a remarkable elasticity and responsiveness to the geeds of different comment ties and to the demands of different ages and regions It has Deyer hesitated to sponsor dew scriptores, des gods, and new institutions It has rejected noge, it has selcomed within its fold all those who have sought its spiritual ladership and social protection and sustenance It thos represents different levels of religious belief and practice and different stages of cultu ral developroept, and offers almost endless grades of spiritual possibilities Indeed the tho great ments of Hipdubm bart becn its concern for the specific spiritual competence of a person (adhıkāra) and its readiness to allow him freedom of worship piog bys chosen dividity (ustadesala) A reference may be made in this very contest to another feature of Hinduism, namely, that Hindu worship is personal ratter than congregatonal in charac ter A Hindu feels as uninhibited adopting any particular religious practice as 10 subscribing to any part cular doctrine
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
The result of all this has been manifold It is true that Hinduism has rarely been guilty of religious persecution It is also true that the tendency of Hinduism to absorb and sanctify whatever it came across has been to a large extent responsible for the fact that it spread all over Jodia rapidly and without resorting to any active proselytisation It may be further pointed out to the credit of Hinduism that the religious absorption which it pro moted was invariably accompanied by a social absorption and Teadjustment But on the debit side it must be mentioned that the over tolerant and absorptive attitude of Hinduism has resulted in lowering the average level of its doctrines and ritual And, what is perhaps still more serious, Hinduism has, on account of this trait, all along been deprived of the compactness and distract characterisation which normally invest a religion with a peculiar strength It should, therefore not be surprising that Hinduism has never encouraged a theocratic state or that it has hardly ever become a state religion
If one might at all speak of any distinctive features of Hinduism, one could mention the belief in the ideological complex of karma sansära mohsa on the metaphysico ethical plane and the acceptance of caste system on the socio ethical plane Incidentally, even here, since Hinduism is essentially an ethnic religion, it is the lattor feature which has come to be regarded as the more basic and compelling of the two As the result of his original igno rance, man gets involved in a whole cycle of existences which has been revolving since eternity (samsāra ) - his doings in the course of one life inexorably governing the nature and conditions of his next life in a perpetual chain of causality (harma) His religio philosophical summum bonum lies in mok sa or his be coming free from this involvement through the realisation of his true nature, that is to say, of his essential identity with the one absolute reality A Hindu is, accordingly, ever obsessed with the quest for moh sa, and his attitude towards life is generally deter. mined by his conviction that a single life in a whole cycle of existences is valueless from the ultimate point of view On the other hand, however, a Hindu does not altogether ignore his
WHAT IS HINDUISV?
individual mundane life &ndash; he makes it serve as the ground for his efforts to attain molsa He believes that the existence in fiux holds a promise for the existence in essence He further believes &ndash;and this is perhaps far more important that the manner m which he Ines bus fife vitally affects the security and solidanty of the society to which he belongs A proper co-ordination between the philosophico-ethical ideal of mok sa and the socio-ethical ideal of dharma, wbuch latter is believed to have found its most typical espression in the form of varrásrama dharma and wluch is re garded as investing the phenomeoal etistence with a meaning and a purpose, may be said to constitute the most central problem of Hinduism Joksa, it is realised is theoretically attainable by any individual by himself, but dharma has to adjust itself with a
given social situation
Apother problem, which has often figured prominently in the history of Hinduism and thich, in the ultimate analysis, is just a reflection of the problem referred to above, relates to the conflict between the traditional dharma or the way of life prescribed in scriptural tests and the eternal or absolute dharma which reveals itself to the enlightened one and to which the traditional dharma attempts to give but a practical expression It is something like the conflict between ‘liw' and `justice' The attitude of Hindu ism in this respect is ambivalent - on the one hand, it inslots on the subordination of the sense of right to the sense of duty, while, on the other, it unequivocally states that, at a certain stage in his spiritual advancement, the true seeker may set aside the injunc tions of the traditional dharma
It needs to be remembered that Hieduism is not a unitary concept or phenomenon nor a monolithic structure It is, there fore, hardly possible to make any statement which can become applicable, without exception, to Hinduism as a whole Hindu ism is, ideed, 25 unpredictable as human nature In the last analysis, a study of Hinduism would invariably amount to a study of the various Hindu castes aod sects The Hindu society ts cut up horizontally into castes and vertically into religious
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
sects - the horizontal stratification having been originally more rigid and more exclusive than the vertical one
Hinduism appears to be marked by several paradoxes and polarities For instance, it emphasizes religious equality among all men and at the same time not only connives at but actually promotes a rigorous social hierarchy It allows complete free dom in the matter of belief but insists on a rigid conformity to caste-rules And what is particularly striking is that, though the lower castes suffer from many disabilities both in the religious and social spheres, one finds that the lower the caste is in the social hierarchy the more religiously conservative and conformistic it usually happens to be Hinduism does not insist on any set form of worship, but this fact itself has given rise to a veritable plethora of religious practices Similarly, on the one hand, Hinduism regards god as a superfluity, while, on the other, it sponsors a deeply emotional theism as the noblest form of reli gion On the one hand, it lays down rigorous austerities and penances for the sake of religious discipline, while, on the other, It seems to permit various orgiastic and sensualistic rites On the one hand it extols moksa, jñana, and samnāsa as the highest religious ideals, while on the other, it also prescribes elaborate rituals which are believed to win starga for their punctılıous per former Hinduism does not countenance any dichotomy of reli gion and philosophy Philosophy is believed to involve man in a very profound manner It is, indeed, understood to be essentially an applied - and not merely theoretical or contemplative - disci pline it aims at concrete, tangible results It is certainly signi ficant that the Upanısads and similar texts often speak of vidjas (pragmatic philosophical doctrines ) rather than of jñana (pure academic knowledge ) Philosophy is thus regarded as an inte gral part of religion This would also account, in some measure, for the paradoxes and polarities mentioned above But the true glory of Hinduism consists in presenting all these polarities and paradoxes as also the various levels of doctrine and practice as constituting a single well coordinated religious system (First published Sinert al Indological Siwlics, Dullt, 1975, 60–96 ]</p>

Hinduism is in no sepse revealed to or founded by any pro phet or messiah. It is, therefore not possible to speak of the specific origin of that religion All that we may do in this connection is to go back to the earliest period in the history of India when some of the distinctive features of the Hindu religion as we know it today had already become manifest Not many years ago, the spade of the archaeologist unearthed a whole civilizauon in the salley of the river Indus - first centering round Mohenjo Daro and then primarily round Harappa - and thereby gave quite a nen onentation to the history of India The age of the newly discovered Indus civilization - which is now more popularly known as the Harappan Civilization - is generally believed to have extended from 3500 BC to 2200 BCA considerable amount of material has become available from the excavations carned out at Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, and other related sites which throws ample light on the various aspects of that civilization, including religion. Indeed, tbe lcdus valley religion 15 perhaps the earliest form of religion in India about which one day make some statement which is sopportable by a more or less taggible evidence Even on a cursory examination, the lodos religion is seen to display certain traits which, on the one hand, conspicuously differentiate it from the Vedic Aryan religion, which, incidentally, had for a long time been looked upon- of course, erropeously-as the fountain-head of Hinduism but which can now be shown to bare exercised but a formal and superficial influence on that religion, and, on the other, establish close and direct affiliations with what may be called classical or historical Hinduism whose many ramifications continue to become esident even to this day Thus, essenually, the Indus religion is

INSIGHITS INTO HINDUISM
a form of Hinduism and may, 10 contradistinction to classical or historical Hinduism, be styled as proto hustonc Hinduism It may, accordingly, be said to represent the first period of the history of Hinduism
Naturally enough, the sources for the reconstruction of the Indus religion are rather limited We do not have any literature or popular tradition relating to it We have to depend mainly on such objects as seals, sealings, figurines, and stone images dis covered at the various archaeological sites wlich have lard open different phases of the Indus civilization But all this material is quite illuminating and can be fruitfully exploited if worked upon with &lsquo;scientific imagination. The first thing which would strike even a casual observer is that, unlike the Vedic religion, the Indus religion was essentially iconolatrous, which feature, rocidentally, is seen to have been shared with it by the Hinduism of the later periods One of the most important objects derived from the cicavations in the Indus valley, which may be presumed to throw much useful light on the religion of the period, is the seal, dis covered at Mohenjo Daro, depicting a three-faced nude male deity with horns, seated on a stool, with penis erectus and with his heels pressed closely together in what is obviously some specific yogic posture This god is shown with an elephant, a tiger, a rhinoceros, and a buffalo surrounding him and with antelopes under his seat He is seen to be wearing a large number of bang. les on each arm and a pectoral round his neck, and a fan shaped head dress Tises between the lions The inscription of six or seven letters appearing at the top of the seal is not yet satisfacto. sily deciphered - Indeed none of the pictographs from the Indus valley has been so deciphered - and cannot accordingly enlighten us on the true character of the figure But the cumulative evidence of the various details depicted on the seal would seem to lead to only one conclusion, namely, that the Mohenjo Daro god was akin to-or cven identical with the Sıva of classical Hinduism The tres faces clearly suggest the irimukha Siva and would

proto-Dravidian aspect, for instance, the god of this religion was celebrated as a &lsquo;red&rsquo; god and was actually called Siva (which word in Proto Dravidian means &lsquo;red&rsquo;) The religious practices relating to Siva consisted mainly of pūjā (which word, derived from Proto-Dravidian, originally signified the besmearing of the god&rsquo;s icon presumably with the offerings of blood, thus confirming the redness&rsquo; of the god) and balı ( which originally meant the offerings of raw oblations like uncooled flesh) Apart from the crude icons reddened with blood, the god of the proto Dravidians seems to have been worshipped also in to other forms, namely, the phallus and the bull
Two other aspects of proto-Siva seem to have been referred to in a Vedic text, namely, the Satapatha-Brāhmana According to that Brāhmana (1 738), proto-Sıva was celebrated as Sarva by the Prācyas or the people of Eastern India and as Bhava by the Vähikas on the Bāhlikas in the North-West
The religion of proto-Siva, which had thus taken deep roots in various parts of India, seems to have been temporarily over shadowed during the interlude when the Vedic Aryan religion bad been firmly and repidly extending its jpfluence But that pre Vedic non-Aryan religion could not be altogether smothered or even ignored Actually, the Vedic religion adapted - or, rather, was construined to adapt - within itself some of the features of that religion, though with evident hesitancy and reluctance The Vedic Rudra represents, both in name and character, an aryanised version of the proto historic Siva Some other features of the religion of proto Sıva also are reflected in some Vedic hymns such as the hymns relating to the muni (that is, the ascetic in ecstasy Rgreda X 136 ), the bralımacārın (that is, the observer of the rigorous vows Athari aveda XI 5), and the yrātyas (that is, the followers of the cult of wandering mendicancy Atharvaveda XV) At the same ume, some Vedic texts suggest, in quite unequivocal terms, the antagonism of the Vedic Aryans towards the followers of the religion of proto Stva, who are variously represented a

Vedic Religion
From the point of view of the history of Hinduism as a whole the Vedic Arjan period may be said to have occurred more or less 35 an interlude It was no doubt an eventful and highly significant period but ihe religious ideology of that period did not certainly exercise on the formation and character of bestoncal Hinduism as sital and far-reacbing an influence as it is usually believed to have done in a sense, historical Hinduism arose as a kind of reaction against the peculiar religio-philosophical cond tions which had been engendered by Vedism - particularly by its later phases Honever the attitude of the sponsors of historical Hinduism was thoroughly realistic and pragmatic. They fully realised the extent and profuodity of the influence of the Vedic way of life and thought and therefore decided, as 3 practical measure, not to alienate themselves completely from it Hia. duism accordingly, not only did not turn its back od Vedic beliels and practices but it actually professed an allegiance to the Veda Itsas tightly anticipated that such as allegiance, homso ever formal and tenuous it might prose in actual practice would belp Hinduism in its escounter with the so-called beretic religious movements of the early post-Vedic period
The Vedic religion, it needs to be remembered was essectually exouc on the Indian soil and, in the vigour of this very erotic Dess, it succeeded in rapidly overs belming the religious complex of the pre-Vedic non-Aran India But, as has been pointed out earlier, it could not obliterate the latter completely Vedism itselt was constrained to assimilate some of its features, albeit reloc tantly, while many of its other features remained generally dormant - but quite viablo among certain strata of society - uptil they acre resuscitated with the rise of Hinduism

Unlike the proto hustoric Hinduism, the Vedic religion can boast of an ample and varied literature relating to it, namely, the Veda Though the Veda is a collection of texts which are essen tially varied from the point of view of literary forms and contents, It is also characterised by the great hall mark of Indian culture, namely, unity in diversity for the sake of the convenience of proper understanding the cultural age represented by the Veda is usually divided into three distinct periods, namely, the Samhita period, the Brāhmana-period, and the Upanisad period It may be emphasised that these three periods constitute not only a chronological sequence but also a remarkable logical sequence It is, verily, this logical sequence which invests the multifarious Veda with a kind of unity Broadly speaking, the Samhılās (only the two primary Samlıtās, namely, the Rgveda and the Athana. seda, may be taken into account here ), the Brālimanas, and the Uranı sads respectively reflect the three phases of the Vedic religion namely, mythology (RV) and magic (AV), ritualism, And spiritualism of course, such a stratification of religious ideology must hy no means be regarded as exclusive It has a reference only to the main tendencies The Rgveda
It was once generally believed that Vedic mythology was naturalistic in character - that it mainly symbolised natural powers and phenomena It is, however, now realised that the narrow frame work of naturalsın is quite inadequate to contain the rich variety of Vedic mythology It was, of course, inevitable that the overwhelming phenomena of nature, with which the Vedic Aryans must have become habituated, should have deeply influ. enced their mythology, ritual, and poetry But those phenomena cannot be said to have constituted the exclusive basis - or even the cssential factor - of Vedic mythology Other approaches to Vedic mythology, such as philological', &lsquo;chno sociological&rsquo;, or &lsquo;my stic psychological&rsquo; are also now found to be quite inadequate by themselves Similarly, generalisations such as that Vedic mytho logy is a mythology in decay or that it is a mythology in the mak ing, are hardly pertinent Vedic niythology is essentially an evolu.

tionary mytholog Its general character has changed in accor dance Rith the vicissitudes in the cultural life of the Vedic people For instance, it would be seen that a certain specific god was re garded as supreme and sovereign in a certain specific period. The reason for this was that the character and personality of that god were in full copformity with what may be called the ethos of that period This is one aspect of evolutionary mythology The other aspect of it is that though the basic character of a dividity was determined by the peculiar environments in which it had come into being that character did oot remain static and stagnant through out It underscot vanous modifications in accordance with the changing conditions of the life of the Vedic Anans to the course of its evolution, many new features gradually accutoulated round that drits so that the total personality which it finally presented was highly complex It is, however not altogether impossible to analyse the complex character and personality of a Vedic god generally isolate from one another the anjous elements 1p that character, and then broadly mark out the different stages in the evolution of that god
Cosmic mythology represented one of the earliest phases of the religious ideology of the Vedic Anans They generally cele brated the divine parents, Dyauh and Prtbui, but the normal growth of these divities into full-fledged Father Sky and Mother Earth respectively seems to have been arrested in the Veda On the other hand, Vedic mythology emphasised another sigoificant feature in this connection, namely, that the unnerse, vast as it was, was pot a chaos, but that it was a cosmos AD inexorable 11w (Rta ) govered in a subtle manoer, the working of both macrocosm and microcosm The concept of the cosmic law or Rta became the centre of a whole mythological complex involving Varuna, Mitra, Adityas and Aditi Varuna, the &ldquo;binder&rdquo; god, held together the estire unnerse by means of his fetters (pasas ) and thereby enforced 11$ regular operation He also punished the transgressors of his law with those very pāsas Varuoa s pa as thus possessed a doubl., significajce - cosmological and ethical Varuna could erercise his authority over the upl

verse as supreme ruler (samrāt) because he was asura or the possessor of asu The concept of asu is perhaps most central in Vedic religious ideology Indeed, it is seen to have vitally influenced the whole religio-philosophical thought of ancient India It was believed that an all pervading magical potence substance penetrated through the universe and thereby invested it, so to say with existence and life This magical potence served as the essential basis of the various aspects of creation such as gods, men animals, trees etc There was, accordingly, an essential qualitative unity throughout the universe It was the varying quantity of this somatic magical potence, which the different aspects of creation such as gods, men, animals, trees, etc, possessed that made them different from one another The Vedic Aryans designated this all penetrating magical potence as asu The larger the quantity of Osu one possessed, the greater was the magical power which he could wield Varuna could effectively enforce the cosmic law Rta because he was believed to have possessed the largest quantity of asu &ndash; because he was asura It may be incidentally pointed out that the godhead of the Vedic gods depended mainly upon their sharing in the magic potence asu
The conditions of life of the Vedic Aryans changed substan tially when they started on their migratory march from the region of Balkh towards Saptasındhu and, true to its evolutionary character, Vedic mythology also changed its main aspect from the costic to the heroic Indra, the war-god, now came to occupy the supreme position which had been held by the cosmic sovereign Varuna Apart from this manifestation of the evolutio nary character of Vedic mythology as a whole, that character becomes particularly evident in the development of the mythologi. cal personality of Icdra In a sense, lodra is the only god in the Veda with a real mythology associated with him the starting point of the Indra-mythology is the mythologisation of history Originally lodra was a human hero who led the Vedic Aryans ia their victorious encounters with the antagonistic tribes which were collectively referred to in the Veda as Vitras and Dāsas, and their

consequent colonisation and establishment of sovereignty in Saptasındhu fadra&rsquo;s epithet puramdara ( smasher of fortresses) would suggest that that intrepid war-commander of the nomadic tribes of the Vedic Aryans was mainly responsible for demolishing at least the last vestiges of the fortified settlements of the pre-Vedic non-Aryan Indus civilisation in this connection Indra s hostility towards the Yatis and the Spadevas which has been referred to earlier, gains special significance It must not, however, be supposed that all the exploits ascribed to Indri in the Veda were achieved by a single individua) Such ascription is obviously the result of the institutionisation of the individual which marks a distinct stage in the process of the mythologisation of history
Indra, the human hero who was transformed into the pational war-god, is seen to dominate the entire mythology of the Rgreda, because the Rgreda-Sanitā as te hare it today relates mainly to the period of conquest and colonisation in the history of the Vedic Aryans Indeed Indra became the symbol of the bieratic religion of the Agreda, and the status of the other Vedic gods in that religion was determined by the oature of the relationship which those gods claimed with Indra
With the conquest of the Vrtras and the Disas ard the subsequent colonisation by the Vedic Aryans in Saptasındha, the historical role of ladra came to an end aod his c&rsquo;ythological role began to be emphasised This was accomplished by superimpos ing upon lodra, basic hunad-bustorical character certain cosmic features Indra the vanquisher of human foes, began to be represented as the vanquisher of Vrtras in nature - he came to be glorified as a rain-god or a storm-god The overpowering of constricting forces in nature and the epliening of cosmic life attributed to Indra was but a cosmicised projection of an authen tic socio-political event in the history of the Vedic Alyans There were still other features which came to be added to the Indra mythology in the course of its evoltron lo almost all ancient mythologies there 1 to be found the primul myth of the conflict between the hero and the dragon, 10 some form or another In the course of the evolution of Vedic mythology, Indra came to be

Two other gods who had become prominent in the religion of the Rg cda were Soma and Agni The religious concept of Soma had arisen already during the proto Aryan period, but, then, Soma had been connected with cult rather than with mythology Originally, Soma was a specific plant, primarily derived from the Mūjarat mountain whose bitter astringent juice played a central role in the simple cultic rites of the Aryans But, while the human hero Indra was evolving into the national war god, Soma cime to be invested with some kind of mythological significance It was suggested that Indra achieved his many heroic exploits under the invigorating inebriation produced by the offerings of Soma made to him Agni, like Soma was mythologically not very significant but his cultic importance was very great If Indra was the pivot of Vedic mythology, Agni was the pivot of Vedic ritual Incidentally, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between the mythological Agni and the ritual fire
It may be presumed that, side by side with the hieratic reli gion of the Samhitā-period, some glimpsos into which have been given above, there had been in existence various forms of what may be called popular and tribal religions Some of these latter, which, incidentally, need to bu distinguished from the religion of the masses as is for instance, represented in the Athanaveda, seem to have become quite a force to reckon with in the religious life of the community - indeed, so much so that the Vedic poet priests were constrained to accommodate them in their mythologi cal scheme This gave rise to yet another motif in the evolutio nary Vedic mythology, namely, hierarchisation of popular cults The most common procedure adopted by the Vedic poet-priests for admittiug a popular divinity into the pantheon of hieratic gods was to associate that divinity - may be in a forced and artificial manner - With Indra who had become the very symbol of berone Vedir rela Mwaer, in the worse of sorok hrvatore upgrading of a popular divitty, the Vedic poct priests, on the one hand scrupulously suppressed such features of the character

of that popular dividity as were disagreeable to the sophisticated hieratic mentality, and, on the other, emphasised such other features of its character as could suggest - however faintly and indirectly - a possible similarity between that divinity and some hieratic god Bat, in so te of such tendentious manipulation on the part of the Vedic poet-priests, some significant traits of the basic ard essential character of that popular divinity did not fail to lurk in the representation of that divinity in the hieratic Vedic mythology
A typical example of such hierarchisation is Visnu - an on ginal fertility-god conceived jo a bird-form who, in the process of his upgrading, was artificially associated with Indra and then came to be regarded as a solar divinity, his origmal bird-form having facilitated the transition from the fertility-bird to the sun bird and then to the solar divinity It may be added in this context, that solarization, that is to say, the superimposition, at some stage and for one reason or another, of the solar character upon the dividities who had originally nothing to do with the sun, was another common motif in the evolution of Vedic mythology Besides Visnu, Pusan, Mitra and Savitr were subjected to such solarization
It is true that, by and large the aspect of the Vedic religion, which was represented in the Rgveda, comprised mainly of mythological traditions and prayers There sas however, ano ther item of religio-philosophical significance which seems to have interested the authors of the Pgreda, and that was cosmology Several Vedic gods were represented as haviog been responsible for the creation, organization and sustenance of the universe, This may be accounted for by the general asuistic' trend of the Vedic mythology Besides such mythological descriptions, however, there are a few typical cosmological theories which have been adumbrated in the Rgleda Io one of the bymas (Rgreda X 121 ), for instance, the process of creation t said to have

started with the emergence of the golden embryo This hymn is important also from another point of view It reflects the Vedic poet&rsquo;s feeling of the general inadequacy of the mytho logical gods and his consequent groping for the true godhead 5 Another hymn (Rgveda X 90), popularly known as the Purusa sūkta describes the universe as resulting from the ntual self inmolation of a hermaphrodite god-man A third current of cosmological thought is represented by the famous Nāsadiya-sūkta (Rgdeda X 129 ), which, in a way, anticipates the later Upani sadic speculation in this behalf
The Rgvedic religion was untconic, but it seems to have promoted a kind of domestic worship centering round the family fire and usually carried out without the intervention of profes sional priests The Rgvedic ritual, as compared to the later brahmanic ritual, was quite rudimentary in character The employment of various Rgvedic verses in connection with the sacrificial ritual was clearly an after thought, those verses were origioally by no means intended for that purpose The Rgvedic religion was also free from most of the extravagances of the theistic Hindu cults, though, it may be incidentally pointed out, the germs of the bhahnı doctrine, which later became almost the hall-mark of classical Hinduism can be discovered in such hymas as those which refer to the peculiar personal relationship between Varupa and Vasistha
Philosophising as such was rare in the Rgieda though it can. not be said to have been altogether foreign to it. One of the most significant features of the religious ideology of the Rgieda is the belief in the magic potence of the mantra or the cultically pro nounced word The mantras possessed a kind of compelling power, and, if properly uttered and employed, they would never fail to achieve the desired end There are also to be found in the Rgveda some indications of religious ecstasy and mystic exaltation, but these are presumably the result of the influence of the religious

practices of proto-historical Hinduism It is to be specially noted that the Rgvedic Aryans gever thought of this life as being just one in the unending cycle of existences aod therefore of little ccasequence, nor did they believe in its being predestiged by the law of Karma and consequently initiative-deterrent Their general attitude was, therefore, essentially life-affirming, dynamic, free from pessimistic gloom, and full of bearty genial piety and feeling of buoyancy and cheer A happy, secure, and prosperous family. life bad always been the goal of the Rg edıc Aryaas The Atharranc Magic
It needs to be emphasised that, from the point of view of the history of religion, the paredu and the 4tl arvaveda have to be regarded as being contemporaneous and as relating to the same community of the Vedic Agads - the Preda berag, by and large, the Veda of the classes and the 4than greda the Veda of the masses Naturally enough, in comparison with the Rgveda, the scope of the Atharrapeda is much wider apd its contents of a more Varied interest It is free from the sophistication and priestly hierarcby which characterise the Rgveda It concerns itself with the common life of the common man from its pre-gatal to post mortem stage, with all its light dod shade, and often reflects
obscure human emotions and uncarny human relations
The basic concepts of the Atharvaseda ideology were that all eristiog eptilies participated in the same all-perradiog somatic magic potence, that, therefore, there was no real scope for such differentiation as between spint and matter or the living and the Life-less or the person and the thing or the abstract and the concrete, and that, - and this is of particular sigauticance from the point of view of the religion of the Athariareda - the magic potence in an eatity could be enhanced or diminished or trans ferred to another entity by means of cultic incantations and action More than any other Veda, the Athartareda aimed at achieving some definite practical end, and that too in a direct tangible manger
A rather unexpected feature of the Atharrateda is that it contains more matter which can be called phulosophical than anyINSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
other Samlua The occurrenee of such philosophical material 10 a book of magic need by no means be regarded as the result of a secondary fusion It should be remembered that the dividing line between magic and &lsquo;non-learned&rsquo; philosophy is very thin Indeed, much of the later Upadisadıc philosophy may be described as the ideology of the Atharraveda magic presented in a specula tive garb In the view of early Vedic thinkers, philosophy was as closely connected with a practical purpose as magic Their basic dictum was that the knowledge of the end to be achieved was the surest means of achieving that end the polarity of the contents of the Athanaveda is thus more apparent than real
Vedic Ritualism
Towards the end of the Samliitā-period, the Vedic Aryans had, by and large, become politically stable, economically secure, and socially organized The transition from toilsome, adventurous, nomadic life to a life of household comfort and leisure did not fail to influence their relgion - more particularly their religious practices Out of the simple prayers, fire-worship, and Soma cult, and primitive magic of the earlier period, there was now evolved a highly complex and complicated system of ritual which soon assumed the status of the only recognised form of religion Elaborate rules were prescribed and rigidly enforced in connection with the various details of the ritual, such as the proper time and place for sacrifice, the sacred fires, the officiating priests, the sacrificial materials and implements, the divinities, the oblations, the mantras, the dah sınā, and the reparation or expiation rites for the errors of commission and omission in the sacrificial proce dure The natural consequence of all this was that the initiative and operative capability in religious matters bow passed, for all practical purposes, into the hands of the newly arisen class of professional priests who claimed a certain amount of expertise in ritual practice and could therefore authoritatively guide the people in their sacrificial performances The need must also have been Celt for literary mabuals wluch described and discussed the many details of the theory and practice of this intricately worked put sacrificial system It was, verily, out of this need that the

In actual practice, however, the exaggerated glorification of Brahmanic ritual stirred up intellectual and social simmerings against the religion of sacrifice in the Brāhmana-period, sacri fice was exalted so extravagantly that it had come to be regarded not merely as means to an end but as an end in itself Not only had sacrifice become the very pivot on which the entire communal life of the Vedic people revolved, but it had also been elevated to the position of the basic motive force of all cosmic phenomena It was then but natural that the priests, who held the key to the theory and practice of sacrifice in their hands should have exerted upon the entire community an intellectual and social influence which almost amounted to domination But such a state of things could obviously not endure for long There arose a band of free thinkers who resented the attitude of blind acceptance, which the priests had more or less deliberately fostered among the people, and therefore sought to replace it with the attitude of uninhibited inquiry Many of these free thinkers came from social strata other than those to which the Brahmanıc priests bad belonged They began by challeaging the two basic claims implied in the Brähniana texts, namely, that the Veda possessed absolute validity and that the purpose of the Veda was exclusively ritualistic They asserted that the Veda embodied only a lower kind of knowledge (aparā vidya), and that the Brahmanıc sacri. fice which placed joordinatcly greater emphasis on the form of religion than on its spirit' represented an inferior kiad of religion (avora i karma) Sacrifice, they insisted, was an unsteady boat' on which one could .11 aTord to rely for success

emerged as quite the forces to reckon with But the decline of Vedism afforded them an opportunity to assert themselves it would, indeed, seem that the rear guards of Vedism had them selves boosted up these religions to a certain extent For, they must have soon realised that the challenge of the beterodox movements could not be effectuely met by mere revivalist efforts A common popular front needed to be built up against them Consequently, most of the popular tribal religions, with the variety of their gods and religious practices, came to be loosely organized into one single but multi-charactered whole, which was held together by means of the thin thread of their allegiance to the Veda This is, in broad outline, the story of the genesis of historical Hinduism It may be noted that Hinduism steered clear, on the one band, of the extreme orthodoxy of the Sūtra-Vedānga revivalists, and, on the other, of the extreme heterodoxy of the religious movements like Jainism and Buddhism While arresting the growth of the anti-Vedic ideology, it successfully combated the insularity and exclusiveness of Vedism by bringing together under its banner large masses of people and, at the same time, saved the Vedic tradition from becoming altogether extinct
The main characteristics of this religious movement may be stated as follows The principal gods of hieratic Vedista like Indra and Varuna came to be superseded by the popular gods fike Siva and Visnu-Krspa The Purāna legends, such as that Krsna did not recognise the Indra-festival, that he protected the cow herds and their cattle against Indra&rsquo;s fury by lifting up the Govardhana mountain, and that he plupdered Indra&rsquo;s garden and snatched away the päryjäta tree, are suggestive of such change of religious loyalties &ldquo;The Upanisads, which are traditionally believed to have represented the culmination, as it were, of the Vedic way of life and thought (they are significantly called Vedānta) had already replaced the gods of the Samhita by the suprapersonal Absolute or the impersonal Brahman Hinduism again energetically revived the religion of personal gods - and this it did with a strong monotheistic bias The god now came to be looked upon essentrally as friend and saviour The elaborate

that as an essential constituent of society, he furthers the process of lolasamgraha through an active awareness of his social obliga. gations The Bhagavadgita has thus invested its teaching with positive social values The sadharma or the special socio ethical obligations of different types of men are, according to the Bhaga radgitā, best embodied in the doctrine of căturiarnja or the scheme of four social orders Honcver, it needs to be noted that, unlike the avoredly brahmadic texts, the Bhagavadgitā never refers to the superiority of one social order to another It consistently emphasizes only the socio ethical significance of that scheme It would, indeed, seem that the maio insistence of the Bhagavadgitū was on man&rsquo;s active recognition of his sradharma or social obligations, the cāfuriornja having been referred to - almost by way of an example - as a scheme, wluch, in the context of the contemporary conditions, best ensured the recognition by men of their respective svadharmas

even in certain hymns of the Rgseda, particularly those addressed to Varuna by Vaisistha (VII 86-88), 10 but it is only in historial Hinduism that devotion to a personal god has been represented as one of the most essential features of religion in his teaching of bhakti, however Krsna has stressed one very sign fcant point, He has insisted that a true harmojogin that is to say, one who adopts the activism as taught in the Bhagavadgitā as his creed, can alone become a true bhahta, for by pursuing his sadharma, the karrrajogin actually subserves the will of god and participates in the divine project Arong other features of the teacting of the Bhagu adgira may be mentioned the erbical idealization of Sacrifice and the promulgation of a portile religio-philosophical synthesis 11

length with the eighteen titles of law It ends with the mention of some expiatory rites (prajalcuttas) and a desultory discussion of a few topics of a metaplıysical character
It was also during this period of the definition and consolida tion of Hinduism as a socio religious system that typical concepts such as those of proirt and maurii, the three mas, the four purusārthas, and more particularly of Karma and samsāra, which last incidentally may be regarded as perhaps the only dogmas (if at all anv) of Hinduism, came to be specially emphasised It may be pointed out in this context that, though, in ancient and medieval India, religion and philosophy were not always sharply demarcated, the various systems of Hindu philosophy seem to have developed almost independently of religion to the course of the first few centuries before Christ, what may be called the Hindu philosophical thought seems to have been, for the first time, crystallized in the form of regular orthodox philosophical systems
While the rise of the dynasty of the Sungas in Magadha, in the second century BC, gave great impetus to the movement of the resurgence of Hinduism, its fall may be said to have marked the beginning of a period of a kind of uncertainty in the fortunes of Hinduism Various circumstances may be said to have been responsible for bringing about this state of things For one thing there was at that time no single paramount politi cal power which could have promoted the advancement of Hinduism It was a period of great social upheaval and unsettled political conditions Adequate impetus could not, therefore, be given to the morentous upsurge of Hinduism which had started in the post-Maurya era, though some efforts in that direction are known to have been made by the hanvas, the Andhras, the Bhārasivas, and the early Vākátakas The religious affiliations of the foreign tribes like the Bactrian Gruehs the Sakas the Pahla vas and the husūnas, who made inroads in India during this period and eventually settled down in this country, were divided between Buddhism ard Hinduism Most of these forcign tribes had sojourned in Serindia before they came over to India and had,

the idea of avatāras Just as Vaisnavism developed round the figure of Visnu, who cannot be said to have belonged to the hieratıc Vedic pantheon,14 Saivism developed round the pre-Vedic non-Aryan god Sıva 18 It is, indeed, remarkable that an austere and ascetic god like Sıva should have been made the object of an emotional and emancipatory love It would seem that the Svetāśvatara-Upanisad, which had sought to elevate the personal god over and above the impersonal brahman, had played the same role in respect of early Saiva theism as the Bhagavadgitā had done in respect of the early Bhagavata theism History shows that, by and large, these two major Sects of Hinduism lived and grew side by side without generating any feeling of mutual ill-will Apart from Vaisnavism and Saivism, the emergence, during the period of classical Hinduism, of several other minor sects is also evinden ced in history and Jiterature
Another very significant aspect of the development of Hindu sects is to be seen in the Tantras Tantra is a genetic term denoting the literature of certain religious cults, whose beginnings have to be traced back perhaps even to the pre-Vedic times but which were systematised and began to become prominent within Hinduism (and, for that matter, also within Buddhism) from
about the Sth century AD This literature cannot be said to have necessarily arisen to oppose the Vedas which claimed some kind of formal authority in respect of Hinduism It was only averred that the Vedas had been all right for the earlier ages, but that their teachings and practices had lost their appeal in the Kaliyuga The Tantras, therefore, took the place of the Vedas as the autho ritative religious literature of this new age Tantrism also opened its doors to all social orders and women Paradoxically, however, while the Tantras, on the one hand sought to democratise Hinduism by removing the barriers of sex and caste in religious matters, on the other hand, they laid down such strict rules for the initiation of the südhakas into their secret practices that they thereby tended to become an exclusive esoteric cult The dogma

tics and ethics of the Tanfras were more or less similar to those of Brahmanic Hipdom, but their distinctive feature was their mystic-magical practices which compnsed such items as mantra
( magically potent formula), bija ( mystical letter forming the essential part of a mantra), Jantra (magic-mystic diagrams), rrāsa (placing of the hands on different parts of the body), mudra ( gesture a buch sought to presente the form of the montra intact), etc The Tantras also dealt with the various details of pājā and orgiastic rites as also of temple-architecture and icono graphy Many of the late sectari20 L parisads are of the nature of Tantras, rhile the infoence of the Tantras op some of the Purāras is quite unmistakable
Unlike the Vedas, the Tartres, whose number is fairly large, are emphatically sectarian in character They relate mainly to the three sects -Sana, Vaisdava, ard Sakta - and the Tantric texts beloogog to these three sects are respectively called Azarras, Samhlás, and Tantras It is generalk belicted that the Agomis onginated m Kashmir, the Tartras in Bengal and Eastern India and the Sanhitas in various parts of this country, particularly Bengal and South India.
The age of the Guptas thus stoessed a solid, opalent, and many-sided expansion of Hindasm A brief reference may be made here to some of the characteristic features of thus grand coltural movement Firstly, it becomes clear from the study of epigraphic and literary records of the Gupta period that classical Hinduism had gecerally developed a remarkable spint of tolerance 176&ndash;175 other religions as also among its ranous sects.&quot; Secondly, this cow, vigorous Hinduism is seen to have given a great fillip to Sanskrit language and literature It may be noted, 10 this connection, that classical Sanskrit was twidely - and perhaps deliberately - used even for popular and secular purposes and that even the Jainas and the Buddhists thought it necessary to write their religio-pbilosophical works in Sanskrit.

parts of the country under the pretext of the various pilgrimages recommended by the popular scriptures and thus carried the message of Hipduism directly to the masses by means of the Purana recitatioos, Hinduism proved in that period a significant force jo unifying the heterogeneous elements of the population 10 a common bond of religion And, finally, Hinduism had then assumed a positive missionary role The movement of the spread of Hioduism in foreign lands had already begun in the earlier period and there is ample evidence of its expansion over the whole of South-East Asid, from Burma to Java and Balt, from at least the second century onwards, though many indications in this connection have been partially obscured by Buddhism which had preceded and tben again followed Hinduism This activity as well as that of the Hinduisation of foreign tribes which came to India continued with equal zeal even in the classical period of the history of Hindựism Proliferation of Hinduism
The next millennium, that is roughly from 700 A D to 1700 AD, was characterized by the vigorously continued proliferation of Hinduism in various directions Hinduism came to be further fragmented into more sects and sub-sects This resulted in the creation of a kind of dichotomy between the smärta Hinduism and the sectaman Hinduism It must, however, be remembered that, howsoever radical a sect might have been, it made it a point not to abjure the parent creed, though some of the sects had obviously arisen under the inspiration of non-Hindu religious ideologies The emergence of these sects usually followed a certain set pattern Some religious leader started a movement with a view either to reforming the existiog vulgarised religious practices or to widening the appeal of Hinduism by claiming equal religious privileges for all castes and classes It may however, be incidentally added that most of the movements started for the purpose of the democratization or popularization of religion eventually tended to become exclusive and esoteric The newly ariseh sects and sub sects centred round specific divini tics, and adopted as their gospels the sayings and sermons of their

They were also, not onoften, barked out from one another on account of their distinctive apparel or emblems Thus, thoogh Hirderm as suck did not smear by any Prophet or any Book ar any Chorch, the sects of Hinduism may, in a sense, be sad to have done so
A notable feature of these sects was that they had artsen not so much to sponsor any specific philosophical tenets as to esta blish and popularize particular types of theism and ways of bhaktı lodeed, it has been aghtly pointed out that, from the 9th-10th centuries onwards, all that is most vital in Hinduism has mani fested itself in the forta of bhakrı Thus renaissance of bhaktı is known to have received its main impulse from South India Lo South India, there were the Nainārs, who, in the first half of the Dinth century, developed a bod of sensuous mysticist for Siva, and the Alvärs, who a few years later, expressed in their Tamil songs a deeply emotional and intensely personal devotion for Visao
But the Vascasa bhaltı-cult underwent a truly exuberant ramification in Northern and Central Ladia from the 13th to the 17th century Two main curteots of devotional porshup could be distinguished in this connection - one relating to Rama and the other to Krona Io the case of the latter, again, there were to be seen two distinct lines of development - one centering round Kosa3 apd bus spouse (as generally sponsored by the saints of Maharashtra ) and the other round Krsna and his beloved Radha (as popolarized, among others, by Timbārla, Caitany, and Jayadeva) So far as Sarvism is concerned, a referece may be made to the Tnka or the Tantric-metapbysical aspect of Sauvism which had become established in Kashimar round about the ninth century AD, the elaboration and systematization of the Sana Siddhanta in South Iodia, and the rise of the Yanows Saira sects like the Kāpāuka, the Kálmukha, the Virasaiva, and the Lingayata

Besides this proliferation of sects and cults there was also 10 evidence a fairly active proliferation in respect of the orthodox philosophical systems
A survey of the history of Hinduism during this long period would bring out two promisent facts Firstly, the influence on Hinduism of non-Hindu religious ideologies has been quite super ficial and therefore almost negligible And, secondly, for its length this bistory must be said to have been marred but seldom by religious persecution either by or of or within Hinduism The missionary activities of Buddhism and Jaroism were generally pacific, and with the Hindu theistic-philosophical renaissance in South India they had become more or less subdued Islam was more aggressive - on the negative side it sought to exterminate Hinduism and on the positive side it aimed at the conversion of the Hindu population The encounter between Islam and Hindu ism, on the one hand, evoked a religio political solidarity such as was evidenced in the Maratha and the Sikh reaction, and, on the other hand, it inspired efforts to bring about a spiritual rapproche ment between the two faiths
Confrontation of Tradition and Modernity
The eighteenth century was a period of staguation for Hinduism Not much activity was evident either in respect of doctrine or of literature But, roughly with the advent of the British rule in India, traditional Hinduism had to face quite a Dew problem - the problem arising from its confrontation with modern culture (In the early stages of the evolution of that culture) 19 The educated classes among the Hindus reacted to thts phenomenon, which was fraught with serious and far reach ing consequences, in three typical ways &ldquo;The remarkable achieve ments of science and technology in the West and the new philo sophies of life to which they gave rise made a tremendous impact on one section of the Hindu intelligentsia They critically studied the situation in Ipdia and concluded from this self examination

that the root-cause of the material and the spiritual poverty of India - yes, even the spiritual poverty, for, the much-flaunted Hindo spirituality was, according to them, to be fourd peither 10 books nor in practice - was the kind of religion which she tradi tionally professed Thes, therefore, felt that this root-cause Deeded to be removed, that is to say, religion had to be rejected Such rejection of religion tool tro forms Firstly it meant the rejection of traditiocal Hinduism in favour of a religion which was considered to be more amenable to modern deselopments, particularly of Christianity The other variety of rejection was far more radical. It cannot, of course, be said to have been restricted only to lodia Indeed, it was a common intellectual attitude which had been engendered by the multiple material forces w post parts of the civilized world This ranety of rejection insisted on religion as such being entirely basished from human affairs But the rexectionists of neither of these two varieties could command any extensive support in fodia.
The second kind of react100 was represented by the equally strongly expressed tendency towards the presenation - either wholesale or selectise-of the beliefs and practices of Hinduism, It was claimed that traditional Hinduism could not and must not be banished, for, it bad efficaciously sened acd would continue to sente as the perennial source of inspiration and the one beacon light for the Hindu millions The traditional Hindu spintuality, it was insisted, nas the only rampart which could successfully with stand the cursed onslaught of the degrading Western materialism Three principal manifestations of this tendency became parti. culary evident (1) the obscurantism of the Varnāsramadharma Samgha and the Ramarājja-Pansad, (2) the Hindu nationa LISTA of the Hindo Mabāsabhi and the Rastriya-Svayamsevaka Samgha, and (3) the fundamentalism of the Aryasamāja
The third kind of reaction resulting from the confrontation of traditional Hinduism with modern culture was reflected in the attempts to restate Hinduism in the light of the newly arisen complex situation in India and the world This tendency may be said to be the ruling tendency of the present times It has its
40
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
origin in the firm conviction that Hinduism possesses the inoate character of what may be called the eternal religion, sanätana dharma, and that it can adequately satisfy the religious urge of any age The past history of Hinduism, It is averred, encourages one to believe that it will be found &ldquo;equal to any emergency that the future may throw up whether on the field of thought or of history » All that needs to be done is to reinterpret Hinduism to suit the changing conditions - and this, it is believed, can be done without any serious violence to the basic character of Hinduism &ndash; or to isolate and emphasize such characteristics of Hinduism as are universal and perennial in their appeal and thereby relate 1t8 teachings suitably to modem developments This tendency towards restatement, reinterpretation, or revision of Hipduism has manifested itself in various ways, but a mention may be made here only of two of these manifestations, pamely, (1) the Brahma Samāja and similar religio-social movements and (2) the Ramakrishna Mission
It is however, a third kind of manifestation of the tendency of restatement and reinterpretation of Hinduism which seems to appeal tost to the Hindu intellectuals today Surprisingly cnough, this kind of manifestation has not taken the form of any organized religious movement like the Brāhma Samija or the Ramakrishna Mission It is largely the result of the endeavours - which are mostly academic in character - of individual thinkers, who, having become &quot; conscious of many of the imper fections and disabilities of the historical faith, seek to find within it by some kind of rationalization, a faith adequate to meet the demands of Indian life to the present age &quot; Their re-evaluation of Hinduism 15 rational, critical, and essentially philosophically Oriented Their attitude is one of constructive criticism tempercd by trust Traditional Hinduism, they are convinced, is by no means free from mistaken concepts excesses, and abuses, but these are but excrescences to be gotten rid of Underneath these are solid, universal principles to be held to without hesita tion The slogan of this school of thought scems to be Change 10 religion is inevitable, but tradition must grow

<p>The roodem age has thrown out a serious challenge to all traditional religions, However, in the course of the long period of its esolution, Hidduism may be said to have acquired adequate strength to meet any new challenge and to respond to the demands of any dew set of conditions more or less successfully and with out allowing its essential character to be vitiated in any way History bears abordant testimocy to this kind of strength of Hodoism But there are also other tal d reasons which seem to
confirm the belief that Hinduisa would be able to adjust itself with modern culture without much contiict
In this connection, it Deeds to be, first of all, noted that many of the clums of moderoism, which seem to imply the futiuty of religion in modern times, have been proved to be inherently ustenable For sastance modern intellectualism, sbuch discounts cances faith because it is said to breed fanaticism has completely failed to realise the true nature of faith and the significance of the role which faith plays in the life of an It must be emphast sed that, particularly 10 the realm of morality, reason 15 uncom plete aod arrested in growth of not allowed to blossom into faith. It may be further pointed out that motion, which is so much aalted in the Hindu tradition but which is generally anathemati zed by modern rigorous rationalism, is not a-logical, but that it is
6.42
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
supra logical Faith and intuition have proved to be veritable sources of strength to man It seems as if, while combating one kind of fanaticism, modern intellectualism has fomented another kind of fanaticism, pamely, the fanaticism regarding the invulnera bility of reason
Modern science claims to have established that reality is ordered, that man&rsquo;s reason is capable of discerning this order as it mainfests itself in the laws of nature, and that the path to human fulfilment consists primarily in discovering these laws, utilizing them where this is possible, and complying with them where it is not It is further claimed that the ever-increasing fund of scientific knowledge has delimited - and, in some cases, entirely negatived - the scope and the purpose of religion Science has, for instance, unravelled the mystery of the origin of the world and of the man, and has thereby rendered religious cosmology and anthropology quite nugatory These and similar claims of modern science have, however, now been proved to be wholly unwarranted by what has been called “post-modern&rdquo; science Scientists now confess that the structure of nature has eluded them They are, indeed, confronted with something which is truly ineffable
It may also be added that several features of modern culture have been found to be not very desirable - jodeed they have been instrumental in stirring up serious crises in the life of man It is true that modern technology has brought about a clearly noti ceable rise in the standard of the material and physical life of man This, in its turo, has given rise to the changed concept of human needs, and to the belief that religion is, by its very nature, not competent to satisfy these needs This may seem indis putable But are not many of the other consequences of modern technology distinctly undesirable? It is seen that technology has tended to promote a social organization which is essentially impersonal in character Technology has also led to the concen tration of authority, power, and wealth-and, what is worse, by its very nature, it does not possess the capacity to lay down the norms in the matter of the use of that authority, power, and
HINDUISM: RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT
wealth Again, the rush of the machine-age has disturbed the equilibrium in human lfe, it has created a kind of imbalance. Sundarly man cd go looser hope to enjoy the personal solitude which is so sery essential for his spiritual health. It has also to be emphasised that the persisting conditions of war have revealed technology in a graie and dangerous perspective. Of course, science and technology by themselves are not to be condensed. Lodeod, med cappot not do without them. All that is intended to be suggested is that the employcent of science and techoology needs to be governed by a proper sease of values
As regards the emphasis laid by modern culture on the freedom of the individual, it may be borde in mind that a wholly free zodiyidcal us as much a myth as a stoly rational individual. Even the caterialistic vien wuch is one of the tcost dominant viens of the present age, looks upon man as &ldquo;a passive creatore moulded and pushed from behind by mechanical forces, a slave of physical energy he can noter control&rdquo; The tso ideals of modern culture, namely, individual freedom ard socialista, bare remaiced incompatible Indeed, the socialization of the radik daal 15 threatening to develop into a mojor CRISIS of the modern tines
The antenability of certain claims of modern culture and the undesirability of several of its features may be said to have actually created ja Lsdi2 - as, perhaps, in many other countries - a propitions atmosphere for a fresh rethinking about the need for religion. Such rethinking in respect of Hinduism is, indeed, now seen to be engaging the attention of Hırda intellectuals
Secondly, certain charactenstics of Hinduism, arising from the sery nature of its cngin and growth, reoder it apable of adequately meeting the challenge of any pest set of circumstances. Hinduism, it may be reiterated, has generally retained free from any kind of institutional rigidity This is surely the secret of its remarkable responsiveness to the changırg condiuops of life and thought. This is also shy Hinduism has contigued to be a “gTowing&quot; religion There is, accordingly, no possibility of any serious conflict arising from the confrontation of Hinduism with
44
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISU
modernity Indeed, one need not be surprised if, in course of time, modernity itself becomes an organic part of the Hindu tradition Tolerance, which is rightly mentioned as one of the most outstandiog characteristics of Hinduism is another factor which has operated as an effecture deterrent of Insular and exclusi vist tendencies in the matter of belief and practice in the matter of religion, Hindu tolerance implies a kind of sublimation of religious feelings - a recognition that religion is polymorphic
A third reason why Hinduism will be able adequately to meet the challenge of modern culture is that Hinduism either already possessed (albeit in a rudimentary form) several of the elements of modernity or it has steadily assimilated them in the course of its evolution Rationalism as such, for instance, is by no means aet to the Hindu tradition. It is well koond that Hindu thought an boast of a fairly well-developed epistemolog Indeed, Nyāya (Hindu system of logic and epistemology ) has played a signifi. cant role in the deselopment of almost every branch of Hindu knowledge. The spirit of inquiry has always been a rulog passion with Hindu thinkers They are seen to have devoted themselves to a fearless and uninhibited pursuit of truth regardless of where it led A Carvila or a Kautilya 25 not unknown to Hindu intellectual histon At the same time it is verily a strong point of Hindu thinlers that they have duly recognised the limitations of human intellect But they refuse to stop at the inevitable intellectual indeterminism Sraddhā or faith, which they have glorified, is actually an indication of their epistemological opti mism
Like modern scientists the Hindus also tested their enou. ledge, limited in scope and variety though it might have beco, pragmatically, that is, by the quality of personal cuperence which 10 made possible For instance, immediate cuperience of reality, and pot merely its mediate knowledge, is the goal towards which all the religio-philosophical activities of the Hindus have been directed
It may be further pointed out that, for a Hindu tbinker, the &ldquo;attitudinal&rdquo; aspect of 3 plulosophy has been more important

than the “cognitional ” aspect What really matters is not what onc &ldquo;knows&rdquo; but what one &ldquo;becomes&rdquo; All this makes Hipduism an essentially mystic-personal religion It Deed not, therefore, come into any serious conflxct with modern culture As claimed by the modernists, the theologic aspect of religion may have lost its raison d&rsquo;etre after the rise of modern science and secular ethics, but its mystic-personal aspect, 35 even the protagonists of moder dity are now generally incliced to admit, will ever remai coeval with maa.
Today, India, like the rest of the civilized world, is witness 10g a major conflict of values In India, as elsewhere there is a distinct shift of interest loterest 10 policies and economics is becoming more and more predominant and the teodency is becoming evident to subordirate all oiber salues to this single salge (TOYS BEE regards this state of things 25 markjog the decay of cullization ) 1o the matter of religion, the Hindu intellectuals bave now generally become listless They are merely dnfting It is clear that the kind of equilibrium which traditionat Hinduism had established has hon been senopsly disturbed by modernisation But it is equally clear that for the sake of social solidanty, a pety kind of equilibrum must be substituted and that Hinduismo, as indicated above, does possess the apacity to mect this challengiog situation in quite an adequate manner Map is essentially a religious creature Constituted as be is, he cannot live without some kind of religion, religion is for hio a psycholo gical and a sociological necessity This being so, irreligion or rejection of religion &gt; positively unnatural The secularism, which is nos accepted by the Indus people as an article of faith, does not imply irreligion or apt-trapscendentalism or non-spin tualty Indian secularism is a positive negative concept.

In the India of today, communities professing different religious faiths and practices have not only to live together in harmony, but they have also to work together in a spirit of active and responsive collaboration Under these circumstances, secularism, properly understood, can alone operate as a positive force in the proper development of the country Secularism, which seeks to subordinate the theologic, creedal, institutional, ritualistic aspect of religion to its mystic, personal, spiritual aspect, does not contemplate an outright reversal of the spiritual tradition of the country It rather promotes a healthy evolution of that tradition so that it may suitably respond to the changing conditions His tory would show that Hinduism could not have anything intrinsi cally against such secularism 19

<p>It has been observed that the basic dogma of the Sophists, whose important role in the history of the Western philosophical thought must not be underestimated, is best represented in the momentous words of Protagoras ( 500 BC), namely, Man is the measure of all things' It bas been further observed that this dogma of theirs has held good in the West ever since If the Iodian philosophical thought anywhere differs pronouncedly from the Western philosophical thought it is, indeed, in this very respect For, the most distject ve feature of the speculative Wis dom of the Indians is its essentially cosmic character According to lodian thinkers, from the ultimate philosoplucal point of view, man cannot be regarded as, in any way, standing apart from the universe, much less as enjoying any preponderance at Their speculations have, therefore, never tended to become anthropo centric They look upon man just as part aod parcel of the Universe - just as one of the maoy forms in which the Supreme Being is manifested in this universe As the seer of the Brhadaranjaka Upanisad' has put in a very telling manner, &lsquo;(The essential self or the vital essence in man, atman), is the same as that in ant, the same as that in gnat, the same as that in elephant, the same as that in these three worlds indeed, the same as that in the whole unterse: It will be accordingly seen that the dualism between * man and other things in the unrerse, wbich is implied in the words of Protagoras, does not find countenance in the early Iodiad thought. A proper understanding of this ancient cosmic ontlook would serve as an adequate background for a correct estimate of the role of man in Hinduism For, that outlook has deeply influenced the Hindu concepts regarding man&rsquo;s relations with himself, with god, and with the world

The constant exhortation of the Upanısadıc teachers is &quot; Knon thuself&rdquo; The philosophical implication of this exhorta tion is that the real&rsquo; man is something different from the man who moves about, acts has various erperiences, in short, Inves&quot; in this phenomenal world In other words, the essential or real sell (ärman) is different from the empirical self (ira) It further implies that the true philosophical knowledge consists in not confusing the one with the other This is evactly the moral of the very famous parable in the Chandogj a Upanisad: Once upon a time, the Upanisad tells us, the gods and the demons became anvous to learn the nature of the essential self, for, at was made known that whosoever knew that self which is free from sin, free from old age, free from death and grief, free from bunger and thirst, which desires nothing and imagines nothog' would win all the worlds So gods sent Indra and the demoos Virocana as their representatives to acquire its loowledge from Praūpati They both lived with Prajapati as his pupils for a period of thirty-two years - this long apprenticeship being a necessary precondition for the great spiritual truth being impart ed to them But, even after this apprenticeship was over, Praju pat would not immediately communicate to them the final truth, He wanted to test their capacity to understand as also their cri tical acumen He, therefore, first told them that the essential self was nothing different from the image that we saw in our eyel which means in simpler language, that the essential self was the same as the embodied self in the condition of wakefulness (ägrat ), when it was conscious of external objects and enjoyed the gross things Thereupon Indra and Virocana became com placeat in the belief that they had understood the truc nature of the essential self Virocana hurried back to the demons and proclaimed that he had acquired the ultimate knowledge which he bad sought from Prajapati At this stage, the Uranı sad slyly adds that those who believe in the identity of the essential self with the bodily consciousness have learnt only the gospel of the demons' lodra was, however, too clever and critical to be satisfied with

this gospel He thought to himself If this body were actually identical with the essential sell, the characteristics of the self, which were made koond to him, pamely, that it was free from fear, sin, old age, death, etc, would prove to be false For, was the body not subjected to fear, old age, death, etc ? Indra, there fore, concluded that there was po glory in possessing that know ledge His thirst for true koonledge was, however, not quenched. So he again went back to Prajapatt Prajāpatı asked him to serve another term of apprenticeship for a period of thirty-two years, At the end of that period, Prajāpati told Indra that the essential self was identical with the self in the condition of dream (stopno ), when the self was not affected by the limitations and characteristics of the body, and when, because only the mind was actise, the self was conscious only of internal objects and enjoyed the subtle things This teaching certainly represented an advance over the earlier one Botesen so it could not satisfy Indra He bethought himself In the state of dreaming, the self might not be affected by the limitations and characteristics of the body, but it was still infoenced by the limitations and characteristics of the mud For, did we not feel as if we were struck or chased 10 oor dream? Did He not experience pain and shed tears? How could this be reconciled with the fearless and painless nature of the self? So, undaunted in his spiritual quest Lodra weot to Prajāpate for the third time Prajapati must have, indeed, been satisfied that Indra was a worthy pupil. After the usual terta of studentship of thirty-two years, therefore, he led lodra a step further in the knowledge of the self He told him that tbe essen. tral self was identical with the self in the condition of deep-sleep ( susuph), when neither the body por the mind affected the self, and when it desired no desire and dreamt oo dream 3 This deep-sleep consciousness was, indeed, free from fear and pain, thought Iodra But it could not be identified with the essential self, for, 10 deep-sleep, we were actpally conscious of nothing, neither of ourselves nor of external objects There might be, 10 that state perfect repose and rest, but this repose and rest was

just like the repose and rest of logs of wood Finding this great deficiency in the teaching imparted by Prajapatı, Indra went back to him and again questioned him about the true nature of the essential self Indra had thus proved himself worthy of recening the highest knowledge So Prajā pati asked him to live a student&rsquo;s life with him for a further period - tlus time only of five years On the completion of that period, Prajapati imparted to Indra the highest knowledge about the self The essential self must not be regarded as being identical with bodily consciousness por must it be confused with the dream consciousness It transcends even the deep-sleep condition, though some satimations of its nature are available in that condition The essential self is, in deed, of the nature of pure self-consciousness, which is beyond all bodily and mental conditions
Through this very suggestive analysis of human conscious ness, some characteristic features of the nature of the essential self are clearly brought out The essential self is identical neither with the body nor with the mind, and is therefore, free from all the limitations, mutations, and experiences to which the body and the mind are liable It is eternal and immutable (sal) As a matter of fact, the distinction between the self on the one hand and the body and senses mind, intellect, and ego on the other is quite fundamental in Hindu thought the essential self must not also be identified with the sum total of perceptions of the senses and conceptions of the mind, though both perceptions and con ceptions necessarily presuppose the existence and the direct apareness ( sāk sita) of the essential self Similarly the essential self never becomes the object of perception and conception in other words, therefore, in the ordinary sense the self is neither the subject or the object nor the act - neither the knower nor the KOORD Ror the knowing in the expression. I know, for instan ce, the essential self is not represented by the word &lsquo;l&rsquo; nor is it represented by the act of knowing But, at the same time, the
I' and the loowing become impossible without the essential self It must be further pointed out that the esscntial self does not imply the absence of consciousness as in the condition of decp

Thus the essential self does exist - 1 is gel&ndash;but not as any particular individual conditioned by the limitations of body, mind, intellect, and ego, and is therefore, not subject to any mutations. It is also consc005-cit-but not of any particular object, external or internal, nor is it to be ideotified with the consciousness in any particular state One annot therefore, realise the true nature of the essential self in any of the three states of conscious Dess, namely, wakefuldess (jāgrot), dream ( stapra) agd deep sleep ( sasuptı) it is in a state which transcends these three, that is to say, in the fourth state ( furijārasha), when body and senses, mind, intellect, and ego cease to fuoction, when there is no koowledge of internal objects bor of exterpal ones, por of the two together, when the self is not a mass of intelligence or Inox ledge, transcending as it does both consciouşcess and unconscious Dess, when it is Jovisible, pocommunicable, incomprehensible, 10defioable, that the nature of the essential self as pore self consciousness becomes realisable through self-intuition.
Besides being of the nature of pure sat (eristence as such) and pure cul (consciousness as such), the essential self is descrr bed as being something more There is another lateresting attempt in the Upanısads to analyse the human personality and thereby attain to the very core or essence of its nature lo this attempt, the seer of the Tautinja-Upanssads proceeds from the grosser forms of the human personality to its subtler forns - It bendg clearly implied that the subiler the form the more real it is. First of all there is the physical body, which is said to be made of food or matter (annamaya) But this cannot be the ultimate or real essence of the human personality For, as the Upansadic teacher tells as, there is, within this physical body, &lsquo;another body which is made of vital air (prāramaja), the fomer is filled with the latter, which is also like unto the shape of man&rsquo;

More internal - and, therefore, subtler and more real - than the body made up of vital air is another body made of miod (manomaja) The former is filled with the latter which is again like unto the shape of man More internal still than the mental body is another body which is made of intel ligence or consciousness (viñanamaja) Within this body of intelligence or COnsciousness is the most internal and central of all bodies, namely, the body of bliss (ānandamaya) This last is the subtlest and, therefore, more real than the bodies mentioned earlier It is needless to add that this description is not to be understood in the literal seose It is not intended to suggest that an individual actually possesses five bodies, one within the other, each being &lsquo;uke unto the shape of man (purusavidha)&rsquo; This doctripe, which is known as the doctrine of five sbeaths (Lošas ), represents a sort of symbolic attempt to analyse the human personality into its five basic elements, namely, physical body, Vital breath, mind, intellect or consciousness, and pure bliss It is pointed out here that each succeeding element in the above list is more internal and subtler, and, therefore, more real and essen tial than the preceding one As the result of this analysis, there fore, we arrive at the conclusion that the essential self in man transcends the physical, vital, mental, and intellectual forms” of the human personality, and must be identified with its 100ermost and subtlest form, namely, the beatific form In other words, man realises his essential self in an ecstatic mystic state, where the only experience is that of pure bliss &ldquo;The ultimate nature of the real or essential self is, therefore, pure existence (sat), pure sell-consciousness (cu), and pure bliss ( ananda )
A reference may be made, at this stage, to another current of thought, through which the nature of the essential self came to be further defined Just as, in his philosophical quest, the Upanisadic thinker looked inward' and thus analysed the human personality with a view to attaining the knowledge of the ultimate reality, he also looked' outward' and tried to apaiyse the external universe with a similar purpose 10 view As the result of this latter analysis he came to the conclusion that, at the basis of this
MAN IN HINDU THOUGHT
manifold and gross phenomenal world, which was changeful and fleeting by nature, and which was, in the ultimate analysis, a mere bundle of pames and forms ( nôma, rūpa), there lay but one eter aal, immutable, sentient reality &amp; Thus this ultimate cosmic reality, or the cosmic self, which, it was frequently emphasised, was one without a second, was also sat and cut It, therefore, naturally followed that the essential self id man (alman) and the ultimate cosmic reality (brahman) were one and the same This grand philosophical doctrine emphasises the fact that neither the empirical self nor the tangible phenomenal world, with which the empirical self seems to come into contact, possesses any reality from the ultimate point of view
To recapitulate the true philosophical knowledge consists 10 clearly realising the distinction between the essential self and the empirical self This should not, however, be misunderstood to mean that an individual possesses two selves The real self is actually one, but, under certain conditions, it assumes an indivi duality characterised by a body-mind-intellect complex. The self with an individuality is the mistaken for the real self The real self is, jodeed, distinct from the body and senses, mind, intellect, etc It is neither the doer ( kartā) nor the experiencer (bhoktā), and 15, as a matter of fact, in no way involved in the doings of the phenomenal world It is essentially immutable and eternal dot being governed by the laws of time, space, and causality It is of the nature of sat, cit, aod ananda, and is, on that account to be identified with the ultimate cosmic reality It is finally pointed out that the true nature of the essential self and its identity with the cosmic self can be realised only in an ecstatic, mystic state (turījárastha), which transcends the three normal states of CODsciousness
This is the most representative view 10 Hinduism about the nature of the essential se&rsquo;n vad Buti is by no mean the only view There are, for instance, some thinkers, who regard the self as, in a sease, finite and atomic There are others who
6

believe that the essential self in man is identical with the cosmic self or the Supreme Being only in essence but not in form
There are still others, who assert that the essential self is distinct from the Supreme Being both in form and essence It is not necessary to examine all these different views at any length It may, however, be pointed out that, in spite of fundamental differences most of them agree in one respect, Damely, in the assumption that the real self is distinct from the body-mind complex
According to the Hindu view, as the result of the operation of original ignorance or nescience (avidyā), the essential self falls off from its pedestal of serene aloofness and self-lumine scence thereby forgetting, so to say, its identity with the Supreme Being of the ultimate reality, and thus becomes involved in the phenomenal world, which also is, in a sense, a fictitious creation of avdā It may be added, in this connection, that the question as to how and why the original ignorance (avidja) becomes operative is, by its very nature, philosophical. ly inadmissible for philosophical thinking - or, for the matter of that, any thinking - can, strictly speaking, relate only to the conditions consequent upon the operation of avidyā When, before the operation of audzā, there existed only one ultimate reality, who could have been the thinker and what could have been thought ?? Starting on the basis of the philosophically necessary assumption of the operation of adja, we can say that, under the influence of asdjā, the essential self (alman) becomes conditioncd by the limitations of individuality Some aspects of the nature of the individual or the empirical self una) will have already become evident in the discussion regarding the nature of the essential sell The most distiactive characteristic of an individual is his assumption of the body lo Hindu thought the term body' (deha or sarıra ) is understood in a very comprehensive sense and is made to denote all kinds of limitations that are produced by and The empirical self or the individual is, therefore, also called chibodied self ( Särira almă )!

The body to which the essential self is supposed to be attached, as the result of the operation of ardia, is, according to the most representative Hindu vies, of three kiods There is first of all the gross physical body (sthala sarira ), which, in view of the fact that it is nounsbed by food, is described as the annamajj hosa referred to above It is regarded as having been produced out of the five elements (parca bhatas), namely, earth (prth77), water (ap), light (rejas), wind (raju), and ether (akása ), and serves as the abode of all the experiences relating to the external world (bhogajarana) It also serves as the basis of the consciousness in the state of wakefulness At the death of an individual only the physical body perishes, that is to say, it dissolves into the five elements out of which it is produced It is, indeed, necessary to emphasise this point namely, that, according to the Hindu vex, death can affect only the physical body and nothing else
There is then the second body, which is known as the subtle body (sūksma Carira) because it 15 constituted of elemeits far sabtler than the five elements (parica bhūtas ) which produce the sthūla urira These subtle constituents of the sūksma sarira are seveoteen in number &ndash; five pranas or vital breaths (prāna (1o the heart ), arāna (10 the anus), samāna (10 the gavel), udāna (in the throat), and fjóra (diffused in the whole body)], five karmendrijas or organs of action ( speech (rak) band (hasta ), feet (põda), dous (pāju), aad organ of generation ( upastha)), five jñanendriyas or organs of knowledge (ear (sotra), ski (tral), eye (calsu), tongue (ha), and nose ( ghrána), mind (manas OT antahkarana), and intellect (buddhi) Consequently the saksa sarita becomes equivalent to the prānamaja (vital), manomaja (mental), and ruñana maja (intellectual) kosas together It serves as the basis of the dream-consciousness As mentioned above, the vital, mental, and rotellectual functions impled by the suksmo sariro become possible only on account of the presence and the direct anareness of the essential self The sul sma sarira thus senses, in a sense, as the indicatory mark (linga) of the presence of the self, and, is, therefore, also called the Imga-sarira
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
But the most important role of the suksma Sarira is the one played by it in connection with the transmigration of the self from one body to another it has already been pointed out that, at the death of an individual, only his physical body (sthula sarira) perishes That does not, however, mean that death marks the end of individualityThis latter, as we shall see presently, comes with the spiritual realisation by the self of its identity with the ultimate reality in other words, with moksa
Till then the journey of the self continues through one body or another What we call death is not the terminus, but only a junction where the self changes the body and also perhaps the route of the journey This goes on until the final destination is reached It is believed that the medium by means of which the self cbanges from one physical body into another is the sükşma Sarira Such an assumption is, indeed, philosophically neces sary For, firstly, the self cannot be assumed to leave both the sthūla and the sūksma bodies simultaneously, that would amount to the termination of individuality, in other words, to moksa Secondly, it is the sūksma sariro, which, in a sease, determines the type of the pbysical body to be taken by the self for the next lap of its journey As we shall see later, the body to be assumed by the individual in his each rebirth is conditioned by the moral consequences of the deeds done by him in the prece ding life It is believed that the sūksma sarira serves as a repository of these moral consequences &ndash; direct (phala) as well as sodirect (samshoras ) &ndash; until they have their effect in respect of the individual&rsquo;s rebirth The direct moral consequences of the past deeds determine the actual kind of the physical body to be taken at rebirth and other environments relating to the rebirth, while the indirect moral consequences produce in the individual certain inpate tendencies which prompt him to act in one way or another in other words, therefore, the sük sma Sarira serves as the medium through which the eternal and inexorable law of karma operates
The third body, which the enpirical self is believed to as sume, is known as tbe karana (capsal) sarira The kôrang Saring

becomes evdent in that state of the existence of the individual in
hich both the physical and the subtle bodies cease to function temporarily, as, for lastacce, in the state of deep-sleep It is ID this body that the individual can get some intimations of the perfect spirtual beatitude Further, the gross and the subtle bodies seem to arise from this body That is why it is called kārana sarta They also seem to dissolve into it, wherefore it 15 called the lasa-sılära
It will be thus seen that it is the empirical self or the divi dual, who, with bis three bodies, becomes involved in the pheno medal world Various other details are mentioned to connection with the empirical self A frequent reference is, for instance, made to the three aspects of his psychical activity, namely, cogni tre, affective, and conatise We are further told that, in the three states of consciousness, namely, those of wakefulness, dream, and deep-sleep, the idividual ts respectively called Falfrānara, taijasa, and prājra. His actions are sad to be mainly of three kinds - bodils (tājika), vocal (Tacika). and mental (mõrasa ) - and, as indicated above, they are assumed to produce certain inevitable moral consequences Then there is also the doctrine of the gunas, accordiog to which the characters of the individuals are the outcome of the mixture, in varying propor uon, of the three principal constituest aspects (gunas ), camely, saltra (knowledge and luminosity), rajas (passion and mobi lity), and tamas (igaorance and passivity) It is needless to say that the essential self transcends these three gunas — IS trigunātita. An individual, 10 shom scifra predominates, is called såltrid and is characterised by knogledge (frana), passiopless detachment (rairāgsa), and glory (aisrarja) An individual, 10 #hom rajas predommates becomes rājasa He is always absorbed in actions being impelled to them by desires, passions, and impulses A támasa individual is one, in whom tamas predominates, and who is, therefore, characterised by ignorance, vice, infatuation, greed, etc,

With a view to clarifying our own ideas in the matter, we may speak of certain distinct stages in connection with the process of what we call the worldly life of an individual First of all there is the stage in which the essential self exists in all serenity and aloofness — mystically united with the Supreme Being As the result of the operation of the original ignorance, avıdyā, the essential self seems to enter into the second stage the stage of individuality It becomes conditioned by the body-mind-complex and is nyolved the phenomenal world, which is, in a sense, its own creation This stage is pregnant with two possibilities Either, on account of true knowledge, the individual shakes off the limitations of his individuality and thus forthwith attajas to the stage of moksa - a stage which, in its nature, 15 identical with the pre-audzā stage Or the individual cont, nues his pilgrimage through various rebirths - this is the stage of transmigration or samisára - until he reaches his destination in the form of moksa
The idea of rebirth is common to several ancient religions of the world But the distinctive contribution of Hinduism is that it has attempted to present a metaphysical and ethical rationali sation of that idea four main principles may be said to be involved in the Hindu theory of rebirths or transmigration (samsára), namely, the permanence of the essential self, the operation of avidyā, the possibility of mioksa, and the doctrine of karma The most fundamental among these pripciples is, of course, the Hindu concept of the permanence (niljana) of the essential self It is quite obvious that, without the assumption of a permanent entity, any talk of rebirth or transmigration would become meaningless That is why the materialists who do not believe in a permanent entity. like the ātman, do not accept the possibility of rebirth The second principle, namely, the ope ration of avidjà, is also quite basic and essential for, avidyā, by causing the essential self to assume an individuality may be said to make the whole process of transmigration at all possible It is interesting to note in this connection, that, according to the Hindu view, the original cause of birth is not any moral error of

lapse For, ardā is essentially a metaphysical concept rather thad a moral or an epistemologcal one Moral or epistemological concepts have relevance only after the process of samsāra b once started Attention may non be drasz to another significant Hindo ven concerniog samsára, namely, that samsāra is neither an idle or unmotnated journey Dor a wild-goose-chase It has been invested with a definite meaning and purpose This is where the third principle, namely, the possibility of moksa, becomes operative For, rroksa represents the ansver to the cternal question whither mankicd
Some general idea about the Hindu concept of molsa will have been already derived from the foregoing discussion about the essential self and the empirical self It would, however, be desirable to emphasise some of the distinctive fearures of that concept To begin with, it must be made clear that, though, in common parlacce se speak of &lsquo;attaining” moksa, the state of moksa is not something essentially different from the real nature of the self It is only for the convenience of speech that ne speak of &ldquo;attaping&rsquo; moksa The Hindu thinkers claim that mokse is not prāpja (to be reached) por uipadja (to be crea ted), por tilārsa (to be got as the result of some modification or change ), nor samkārja (to be got as the result of some operation for refinement or perfection) In other words, in the Hiodu yew, moksa is native and not densauve so far as the individual 15 concerned Voksa does not imply that the self acquires something which does not belong to it or, to be more precise, something which it is not As a matter of fact, moksa meaos realsing one 5 000 tre- self It is already there though one becomes temporani; bund to it order the influence of adj. Paraphrased in popular Loguage, man is really god Godhead is, jadeed, his real nature It is only through the accident of ignorance that he feels drested of that datu-e. Such a ven 15, indeed, morally very significant, for it elevates man by denying all creatureliness ” 10 respect of him.
When it is claimed that mok so is aatuse to man, another claim made by the Hindus also follows it by way of a corollary,
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
namely, that mok sa is the birth-right of every individual This view, it will be seen, is the very antithesis of the doctrine of god&rsquo;s grace According to it, man himself, and not any extra neous power, is responsible for his emancipation It is, indeed, this assurance which gives a meaning and a purpose to one&rsquo;s life Man learns to look upon life not as a journey without an epd or purpose but as soul&rsquo;s pilgrimage to be terminated at moksa Even if moksd is not realised in one life, man is sustained through all the stages of transmigration by this message of faith and hope that nobody can depriye him of his bith night, namely, moksa
About what may be called the content of moksa, the only thing that we can say is that, from the individual&rsquo;s point of view, moksa consists in throwing off the shackles of individuality and thereby passing into the mystic state of spiritual union with the Supreme Being There is, however, another view of moksa, according to which mok sa represents mainly a certain attitude of mind- an attitude whereby the individual develops a universality of outlook, so that, even after the discernment of the truth which comes to the liberated soul, he still retains his individuality as a basis for action in this world This is the condition of being jivanmuhta (emancipated while living) The Hindu thinkers, indeed, speak of three kinds of liberation - liberation attained forthwith at death (sadyomuhtı or videhamuki), whereby deatb really renders one deathless, liberation by stages (hramamuktı), and liberation while living inanmuktı) It is this last, which the Bhagavadgua glorifies as the highest deal of man, an ideal which that philosophical poem has emphasised in its descriptions of sthiraprajña, the yogin, and the bhakta
To revert to the theory of transmigration it may be said that if the operation of avidyā is the cause of the birth' of an indie vidual, the operation of the law of karma, which is the fourth principle involved in this theory, is the cause of his rebirths' It may be further pointed out that, out of the four principles

involved in the theory of transmigration, the first two are meta physical, the third is significant both from the metaphysical and ethical points of vert, and the Last, panek the doctrine of karird, is predominantly ethical. It would, however, be necessary and desirable to esamine the doctrine of loma a little more closely
The doctrice of karma is one of the most distinctre features of Hipdann It will be seed to have cfluenced most of the important Hiodo teachings and practices It is, it should be Temembered, the essential element got onls of Hindu ethos but of the entire popolar bel ef of the Hiodes The faiths of India differ widely, at some points being the very poles 25beder But all of them, orthodox as rell es heterodor ( with the exception of materialists like Carvita), accept this doctice as oge of their andpal tenets.
The doctrme of kerma represents the solution offered by Hinduism for the great niddle of the ongn of soffermag ard in equality of human conditions in this world According to the Hodus, the law of cacsation operates not only in respect of the phys cal world, but it operates in an equally invariable and inyolable manner, also in respect of the moral rorld All acts that ap adındaal does tpevitably led to some results, good or bzd, and the life of the indivdual, who dox those acts, becoces conditioned by the consequences of those acts We cannot think of any acts which fizzle out vihout prodccing resolts (intopra nāša) por of any results which have to antecedents in the form of come acts (chrtābhyuragarra) This is the icexorable law of karma, the lau of actions and their inevitable results It most, bow ever, be added that the doctrme of Larra does cot denote merely this more or less mechanical theory of retribution. It also imples some definite moral principles Morally good acts recessarily froduce good results and morally bad acts bad results It can be empirically proved that there is perfect justice the fuactioning of this law But we often see that all acts of 20 individual do pot fructify within the bref span of a single Lfe What, it may be asked, becomes of those acts According to the Law of karma,INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
no actions are barren It, therefore, becomes necessary to postu late another life for that individual, during which he may reap what he has son in the preceding life As a matter of fact, we have to assume by a logical extension of this postulation, the existence of a series of lives in the case of an individual This is the theory of somsira, which thus becomes a necessary corollary to the law of harma
The present life of an individual is conditioned by such of the acts done by him in the preceding life as had not attained their fructification during the course of that life The moral conse quences of his past conduct and behaviour are, so to say, conser ved and have their effect in the present life His past acts, for sostance, determine the kind of body which he may assume, the family, society, and position in which he may be born, and the acts which he may do in the present life To put it briefly, every creature is the creation of its own past deeds The otherwise inerplicable vicissitudes of life and incquality among human beings are thus rationalized by the doctrine of karma Nothing 10 this world, physical as well as moral, happens as the result of mere caprice or blind chance In every happening we have to see the operation of an immutable law. As a matter of fact, such a law has been postulated at a very early stage in the evolution of Indian thought in the Rgieda, for instance, we come across frequent references to rta, the cosmic magic law which governs every happening in this world - from the mightiest workings of the powers of nature to the tinast activity like the winking of the eye The Vedic rta may, therefore, be said, in a sense to be the Vedic version of the Hindu doctrine of harma
If, then according to the doctrine of karma, whatever we are and do is prcordained, is harma not just another name for fata lism? Is man hereby not denied his initiative as a free agent? Is he not reduced to thic unenviable position of a helpless victim of &amp; mechanical law? What interest can he have in a life which it is not in his power to invest with a purpose and a meaning? Let it be said at the outset that these and similar other questions, though natural on the face of them, betray an inadequate under
MAN IN HINDU THOUGHT
standing of some of the essential features of the doctrine of karma This doctripe, it should te clearly understood, does not imply the operation of any extraneons factors in man&rsquo;s life and doings No erternal power such as fate or destiny, is assumed to be shaping the life of man Considered critically, the doctrine of karta #ill be found to be teaching that man himself is, in a seose, the architect of his life What he did in the past life 18 entirely responsible for what he is in the present life So viewed this doctrine becomes the very opposite of fatalism It deletes caprice or chapce and discountenances the working of an over nding providence The causes of an individual s life and actions are to be ultimately traced back to the çndividual himself And, as indicated above, the life of ad individual may not be limited to one life only
Two objections are likely to be raised against this position Even assuming that, in this sumsåra the actions of an iodividual in the preceding life condition his next life, it may be asked what about his first birth in the series of rebirths? There is no possibility of any anterior actions and their retribution in respect of that birth Therefore, so far as that birth is concerned, the law of karma would pot operate that is it that would condition ap adividual&rsquo;s life and action at that juncture? Such a question is pbilosophically inadmissible According to the Huadu thought, the samsāra is begingjagless (anadi). It is impossible to visualise an individual without antecedents For, strictly speaking, individuality itself is the product of antece denis If the essential self is unaffected by any antecedents, it does not become 11able to be born at all and so to assume any lodividuality

INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
over his past actions which govern his present life? He cannot alter their course the past, although it is his past, is already a fait accomph, and it is this that determines his present, thereby leaving him do freedom to shape it as he would like He cannot, for instance, say In my present Iife, my action shall be only such as will inevitably lead to a better life next time He cannot say this for the simple reason that his actions in this life are not really his They are predetermined Such an objection is met by the Hindu thinkers by postulating a twofold fructification of all actions Firstly, every action produces its direct result (phala) The phala of our past deeds is that they determine the nature of our present body and the conditions directly relating to and consequent upon our birth In respect of these we have no choice We have to accept them as they are ordained But our past deeds also produce what may be called their indirect result in the form of our innale tendencies ( sanıskāras) It is these samshāras, produced in us by our past deeds, which prompt us to act one way or another it is, however, necessary to emphasise that the samskäras only prompt but do not compel us to act in a particular manner This fact affords ample scope for initiative and self-determination on the part of an ipdividual He can, if he will, control and direct his samskäras Though, therefore an individual&rsquo;s birth and initial environments are predetermined, he has before him the gratifying prospect of being able to master his sanskaras, which are, indeed, the main sprogs of all his actions The doctrine of karma thus includes within itself also the possibility of moral progress in spite of the initial conditioning of our present life we can employ every moment of it to make ourselves as we will And when it is realised that the present life represents not the whole term allotted to an individual but only a stage in the soul&rsquo;s progress towards its goal, even that partial predetermination should not matter much
It will be thus seen that the doctrine of karma does not imply fatalism nor does it preclude the operation of free will, which is the very basis of ethical conduct Teaching as it does that, in the ultimate analysis, an individual is himself the architect of his

own life, this doctrine countenances no such thing as cruel fate or unjust god It produces in man the faith that it is never too late to mend Though apparently a blind mechanical force, karma, it must be remembered essentially represents the cosmic power of righteousness which forever encourages man on his odward march towards a higher spirtual goal
Though, in the Vedic literature, there are but few indications of the doctrine of karma,lo in the later Hindu thought, it held a very commanding position Indeed, 10 some schools of thought like the Sāmhhia and the Vimámsā, karma came to be regarded as such an all pervading power as to render god almost super fluous In other schools, god was conceded the position of an impartial administrator of the law of karma But, in any case, the idea of god&rsquo;s grace was considered to be entirely incompati ble with this doctripe The significance of this doctrine from the point of view of the social organisation of the Hindus would be. come clear from the important part played by it in connection with the consolidation of the caste system
With all that has been said so far, there would still remain one final difficulty about the doctrine of karma How can karma be reconciled with mohsa which is universally recognised by the Hindus as their spiritual goal? Is the law of karma, in a sense, not the very antithesis of moksa? Do even morally good actions Dot continue to keep an individual lavolved in life howsoever ethically high it might be? The Bhagavadgită has shown a satisfactory way out of this difficulty 11 It teaches that man&rsquo;s actions attain their fructification in the form of phala or sams käras affecting that man only if he performs those actions with a feeling of attachment for their results If, however, he acts — AS required by the law of karma, bus, at the same time, properly controlling and directing the samsläras &mdash; in a spirit of passionless detachment 10 respect of the fruits of his actions, he would, while doing his svadharma, be still leaving the road open for the soul&rsquo;s

If the philosophical approach to the problem of the role of man gises rise to the dualism between the essential self and the empirical self, the religious or theistic approach presupposes the dualism between man and god Let it be sard, at the very outset, that the dualism between man and god is philosophically inadmis sible For, as shown above essentially man is god As a matter of fact, from the ultimate philosophical point of view, the very concepts of man and god cannot be said to possess absolute rea Inty They belong to the realm of the phenomenal world This will account for the fact that many philosophical systems in India are essentially atheistic They are not required to posit the exis tence of a personal god in order to answer the various cosmolo gical, psychological metaphysical, and even ethical questions which they have mooted in the course of their spiritual quest This does not, however, mean that Hinduism has nothing to do with god On the contrary, Hinduism — particularly popular Hinduism — is crowded with gods Hinduism is certainly god conscious — perhaps very much so! This need not surprise us It really redounds to the glory of Hinduism that, in it, absolute monistic idealism and passionate devotionalism should abide side by side and without any conflict What is still more creditable is that Hinduism has achieved this marvellous feat in 1 more or less rational manner, namely, through the assumption of the pos sibility of two points of view in philosophical matters &ndash; the abso lute (pāramārthika) point of view and the relative (vārahi rika) point of view, the one not spurning the other, each posses sing reality in its own way and each independently leading to the final goal The proverbial catholicity of the Hindu mind is also, in no small measure, responsible for what would appear to a casual observer as the paradoxes of Hinduism Indeed, one of the most striking of such paradores is to be seen in the fict that a staunchi monistic idealist like Samkarācārya has composed some of the swcetest and most stirring hymns in praise of personal disinities.

od man is in many ways iniuerced by the relation between the Supreme Being and the essential self Therstically the goal sought after bv man is either to live in the same world as god (salokatā) or to be nearest to god ( samipatā), or to assume the same form as god ( suructu), or figally to achieve intimate UDIOD with god ( sa ulata) It will be easily seen that, while the first three goals rore or less represent the stages leading to the last goal, the last goal is but thertic reflection of the philosophi cal goal of the mystic Lnion of th essential self with the Supreme Being The philosophically accepted identity between the Supreme Being 30d the essential selt is sometimes qualified in theism by suggesting that god and en are idectical in essence but diffe rent in form What sparks are in relation to fire, man 15 10 relation to god A further development of this partial separate ness of man from god is that god is described as being not really extercal to mao but as being the antur;ūmin (100er controller) of man God is really the efficient directive cause (prajojaka karta) 10 man s life
The philosophical doctrine of the perfect identity between the Supreme Being ard the essential selt is thus first modified into a doctrine of qualıted identity or partial separateness between god and map This latter is then carried still further in the direction of complete djalism between god and mag God is then conceived of as the creator and the moral governor of man and the universe Particularly in respect of man he plays the role of the dispenser of the lay of karma It is however, irteresting to note, in this connection, that, even accepting the complete separateness and the ale inspiring distance between man and god, 1 Hindu seeks to achieve a direct personal communion with ged through a complete surrender of his whole being to god This is the ideal of a Hindu devotee (bhakta)

Devotion (bhaktı), according to the Hindu view, implics, firstly, dedicating all one&rsquo;s actions to god, rerdering service to him, and meditating on him in single pointed concentration, 12 it further implies ridding oneself of all consciousness of &lsquo;I&rsquo; ness and &lsquo;my&rsquo; ness18 and developing in oneself an attitude of being the same to all gods beings whether friend or foe,&rdquo; and, paradoxical as it may seem, it finally implies creating in oneself a peculiar mystic power through surrender, humility, and faith 16 Prayer, worship, ritual iratas (religious observances), etc, do have a place in the Hindu religious practice But the doctrine of true bhaktı, which involves such items as consciousness of sinfulness on the part of the devotee, his complete self-surrender before God, his earnest longing for a close personal communion with Him, and the mystic experiences that he has in His companionship,18 must, indeed, be regarded as the most potent facior, which, in Hinduism, governs the role of man in relation to god
Let us now try to understand the role of man vis a vis this world in general and his fellow beings in particular In this con nection it may be recalled that, according to the higher philoso phical thought of the Hindus, the essential self of man is never in volved in the happenings in this phenomenal world From the ulti mate point of view, therefore, the question about the role of man, the &lsquo;real&rsquo; man, in this world would have no relevance whatsoever Even with reference to the empirical self the consideration of such a question would have but little intrinsic value For, the highest spiritual goal of a Hindu is to transcend the limitation of his indi viduality, which binds him to this phenomenal world, and so to realise his identity with the Supreme Being, which is, indeed, his native character Life in this world is accordingly to be looked upon as a bridge, over which one has, of necessity, to pass in

order to reach one s destination, but on which it is unwise to build one&rsquo;s house Van&rsquo;s role to this world thus pertains to an essentially lower stage of expenence, and is generally treated 25 such by the Hindu thinkers. The usual charge that, in India, ethics is regarded just as an &lsquo;asıde&rsquo; from the serious business of philosophy &ndash; a concession, as it were, to the necessity of man&rsquo;s contact with the phenomenal world cannot, therefore, be said to be quite unjustified It must be admitted that Indian philo sophy transcends the merely ethical level as much as it does the merely rotellectual level.
This must cot, however, te Misunderstood to mean that the Hiodus have altogether neglected this aspect of the role of man Hinduism does offer man an expert guidance for a safe and speedy passage over the bridge of life Its most significant contribution in this respect is the concept of dharma Dharma is, indeed, a very elusne term and has denoted different things in different contexts It may mean Vedic ritual, or religion and ethics in general, or aste rules, or coul and criminal law But the vader lying basic idea is everywhere the same Dharma seeks to resolve the inevitable conflict between the real and the phenome nal, the spiritual and the material, the eternal and the temporal. It recognises that, while string after the ideal, man cappot afford to overlook the actual Drarra thersfore lays down a way of life which aims at securing the material and the spiritual sustenance and growth of the individual and the society It is a unique joint product of the speculaute and the practical wisdom of the Hindus It would now become clear hon it is possible to speak of different kinds of dharma, such as rarnadharma and asramadharma, corresponding to the different relations subsisting between man and the world or society
It may be asked how is it at all possible to get oser the obvi ous opposition between the individual good and the individual ends on the one baad ard the social good and the social ends on the other? The ultimate goal of the individual, namely, mok sa, presup poses that bus constant endeavour should be, as far as possible, to isolate kimself from this world In other words, the individual is
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
expected to follow the path of resignation and actionlessness (nartimürga) The goal of social stability and progress, on the other hand, requires for its realisation positive efforts on the part of every member of the society Unless, therefore, every individual were 10 play his part in this world with active interest and a sense of responsibility - unless, in other words, he were to follow the path of action (prarumärga)- the sociaty would disinte grate There is often observable a tendency to regard these two ways of life — the way of action (karma) and the way of renuncia tion (samınjāsa) -as mutually exclusive and to extol one at the expense of the other The Hindu view of life, however, is gover ned by an implicit faith in the efficacy and validity of both these ways and in the possibility of reconciling the claims of action and renunciation In a sense, this faith is the very motive force of Hindu dharma It is fully realised that the life of actionless contemplation is as much fraught with evil as the life of attach ment and bare activity The sage of the Isaiasja Upanısad (9) tells us “To pitchy dart ness do they go who pursue the path of audja, that is, of bare action To greater durkness still, as it were, do they go who are absorbed in the life of bare krowledge and meditation (idyā)&rdquo; The ideal set forth in this connec tion, therefore, is to synthesise these two ways of life is such a manner that one does not prove an impediment to the other, and both together facilitate the realisation of mok sa for the individual and solidarity and progress of the society It is not action per se which entangles man into the turmoil of this world thereby ren dering his chances of liberation remote The root cause of this evil is not action but the passion and attachment which accom pany that action Fruitsul actionlessness, therefore, consists in the annihilation of such passion and attachment and not in the abandonment of action itself This is the anāsak 11 Joga of the Bhagavad. Itā, which implies Itnunciation in action and not of action
One of the most typical results of this ideal of life is the Hindu doctrine of the four ends of man (purusārtlas) The Hindu thinkers have recognised that man possesses a complex

explain the why' of it This problem of the inequality of human conditions has, indeed agitated the minds of great thinkers of all times and of all climes As we have seen, through their doctrine of karma, the Hindu thinkers have made an out standing contribution in this regard It is, therefore, necessary that that doctrine 15 always present in our mind while we exaraine the aśramadharma and the rarnadharma
The āśramadharma, or the Hindu scheme which aims at an ethical organization of an individual&rsquo;s personal life with a view to a fruitful synthesis of the way of action (pravrttı) and the way of renunciation (marttı) as also to the realisation of the four ends of man (purusārthas ), is undoubtedly a unique contri bution to the ethical thought of the world From the historical point of view, the ongin of this scheme is to be presumably sought in the impact between the Aryans and the indigenous communities of India The outlook on life of the Aryans, as re presented in the Rgveda, is essentially characterised by an exube rance of attachment for and interest in living That Veda does not generally show any traces of renunciation or attitude of resig. nation on the part of the Aryans On the other hand, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that there existed, among the 10 digenous people of India, several religious sects, like those of the Vrātyas, the Brahmacārıns, the Munis, and the Yogiasl? who seem to have lived a life of detachment from the affairs of the world a life which was, besides, characterised by great austerity and rigorous physical and spiritual discipline 18 It can be assumed that, perhaps on account of the miraculous powers which the members of these sects were believed to possess, they wielded a peculiar influence on the commonalty of the people Their way of life must have also had an irresistible attraction for maoy of

them This was a phenomenon about which the Brahmapic thin kers could not have remamed altogether indifferent. An organic scheme must have therefore, been gradually evolved in the form of the asarradharma, which afforded foll scope for the operation of the protetti-tendencies of the Aryan colonisers and the nitrtti tendencies of the pre-Arya anchonites In this connection, it may be icadeptally added that the origin of the ladian caste system also has to be discovered in tbe impact between the Aryan immigrants and the indigenous Indian communities
There was another factor o hich must have helped the formu lation and the consolidation of the asramadharma It was the great ethical concept of the three deb&rsquo;s ( rratraj a ) 1: Every indi vidual, we are told, is born with a bability of three debts, which he is expected to requite dunog his life There is, first of all, the debt which he ones to god ( dera-ra) of this he can redeem himself by dedicatiog his life to the service of God and to the proper promotion of the scheme of things as laid done by Him There is then the debt to the seers (rsi-rra) shich he an repay by presening ard eonching the cultural hentage handed down to him from age to age Lastly there is the debt which he ones to his ancestors (pur-ma) This te aan discharge by procrea ting good progeny and thereby ensuring the contjquity of the human race The avemadnorma organizes the life of an indryl dual in such a mapper that he remains ever picdful of his sacred obligations and is also given adequate opportonities for their redemption
The word ašrania literally means erertion or the place where such exertions are performed By an extension of this meaning, the asramas came to denote the main stages in an iodividual&rsquo;s life, which, if properly organized, itself becotees a planned exertion. According to the Hindu vex, there are four such stages, which follow one another jo succession - brahmacarja (life of a student),

After the rite of initiation (upang, ana ), which was very significantly regarded as his secord birth, a child commenced his life of a student He approached his teacher with fuel in hand - a gesture which was symbolic of his willingness to obey and to serve For the next few years - the normal period of brahma carja extended over twelve years, though it varied in some cases - he had to hive at the house of the teacher devoting himself fully to the achievement of the three main goals of studentship, namely, the acquisition of knowledge, the building up of character, and the preparation for the shouldering of the responsibilities which would devolve on him in future life. This compulsory stay of the student in the teacher&rsquo;s house had its own advantages For one thing it excluded the possibility of any conBict arising between the teacher and the parents in the matter of the method and the contents of the education of the child For, during the period of studentship, the role of teacher and father were combined in one person 20 Moreover the constant personal contact between the teacher and the student was bound to have a sterling influence on the moulding of the latter&rsquo;s mind and character There is, indeed, mentioned in the Veda a symbolic rite whereby the teacher magically transferred his splendour to the pupil -1
Normally, student was expected to live by begging (bhiksă carana) and was not required to pay any fixed fees to the teacher Soare very important principles of education were involved in this practice Begging implied that it was mainly the responsibility of the community to maintain the student It also engendered the habit of a simple and selt reliant life and fostered the necessary sense of equality among students Besides, since no fixed fees were laid down, the education of an individual was not made dupendent on his economic condition The Hindu

and not a contract The real significance of the Hindu marriage is not that it represents the fulfilment of any important purposes of life, but that it marks the begioning of a more responsible and purposeful life to come The sacrament of marriage and the various restrictions relating to endogamy and exogamy which normally govern every Hindu marriage imply a perfect biological, psychological, moral, and spiritual union of husband and wife The relationship between the two is governed by the sentiment of loyalty and devotion to each other until death 27
Hindu thunkers have often emphasised the social purpose of marriage, namely, procreation of progcny (prajanana) and conti puation of the line (santāna) It must, however, be pointed out that marriage does not by itself constitute a full social institu tion But it certainly lays the foundation of the most funda mental of all the social institutions of the Hindus namely, family Normally a Hindu family is a closely-knit group of persons related to one another by blood But consanguinity, it must be remembered, is not the only force which keeps a family together Far more effectively operative in this respect are the remarkable affections which develop among the various members of a family
They are really bound together by the bonds of mutual respect, devotion and love this characteristic of the Hindu family is rightly regarded as one of the most attractive features of the social life of the Hindu A Hindu family implies common residence, common kitchen, common property, common worship, and consequently, common experience of the joys and sorrows of life for all its members Such an arrangement has many advantages For instance, it necessarily encourages a feeling of identity of interests and promotes the consciousness of all for each and each for all' For the sake of solidarity, an individual learns to subordinate his own interests to the interest of the family Sacrifice is, indeed, the keynote of the harmony of the family It will be seen that, in actual practice, family offers adequate protection and support to its weaker members, such

But even this partial and passive contact with the affairs of the world a man is not inclined to continue for long. He, therefore, soon enters into the last stage of life - the stage of complete renun. ciation and solitude ( sam jasa Hus one and only aim must now be the realisation of spiritual freedom of mystic union with the diszne It is here necessary to emphasise the distinction between asceticism (samnjāsa) and austenty (tapas) While, by means of tapas, one seeks to achieve more or less superhuman poners to be used mostly for materialistic and secular purposes, samnjāsa aims at purely moral and spiritual ends A samnijāsın must drown his consciousness of &lsquo;I ness ( ahamkāra) and &lsquo;my-&rsquo; ness (manahära)- he must cut himself loose from the limita tions of individuality and so prepare himself to realise the goal for which he has served, during the first three asramas, a sell-planned apprenticeship
It will be seen from the foregoug statement that the asrama dharma provides a Hindu wub an outline of a well-defined plan of life, complete with its four fixed stages, each stage having its OND compler of duties All that an indivdual is expected to do 15 to fill in the details in accordance with his propensities and capacities Indeed, this pattern of life, though a unique feature of Hinduism, is so universal a character that it can well become acceptable to all people and at all times The m3in strength of the asramadharma perhaps lies in the fact that it lays down a graded discipline which is eminently suitable to the physical and mental development of man at different ages Another significant point to be noted in connection with the astarradharma is that, according to it, mans whole life constitutes a great and noble sacrifice (Jajra) It evinces an indomitable faith in the possibility of progress only through service and sacnfice It should be further noted that, though the asramadharma pertains mainly to the personal life of an individual, it incidentally seeks to deter mine the responsibilities of the individual and the society in respect of each other in the first asrama, it is the responsibility of the community to look after the individual while, in the life of a householder, the individual is enojned to promote communa)

life through service and sacrifice The third stage (vanaprastha) represents a somewhat neutral phase, and, in the last stage, after having lived a useful social life, the individual 1s pormally inclined to concentrate on his own spiritual emancipation Finally it should be noted that, true to the main trend of their thought, the Hindu thinkers have taken care to emphasise that the aśramadharma must not be regarded as an end in itself To use a classical metaphor, the aśramas merely constitute a four runged ladder which an individual has to climb in order to reach his ultimate goal
As if to make the broad scheme of the asramas more tangible and definite, the Hindu thinkers have correlated it with their more minute scheme of sacraments (samskäras ) A sacrament is generally defined as a religious rite which is intended to mark the creation in an individual of some inward spiritual grace Promi nent among the various elements which constitute Hindu samska ras are sacred fire, prayers ( mantras ), sacrifice, lustration,&rdquo; ori entation, symbolism,&quot; taboos,&quot; and magic 46 Each important

43 Certain details of the artaments are fixed in accordance with the popu lar beliefs relating to the different quarters In all auspicious sacraments, for instance, the individual is required to face towards the east, which is believed to be the quarter of light, life, and energy South is the quarter ol the god of drath, the dead body is thereforc, placed on the funeral pytc with the head towards the outh CE also circumambulation pradaksin), that is going round the object of worship in such a way that it will always be on the right hand side
44 Material objects are used as tymbols (pralika ) of spiritual qualities for instance, stone is the symbol of fixity and steadfastness. In marriage cerc mony therefore the bride 13 asked to step on a stone ( amarahang), to fuggest stcadastness in her devotion to the husband

juncture in the journey of life 15 sanctified by means of a sacrament As a matter of fact, sacraments touch the life of an individual from before his birth antil after his death For the first sacrament ja the series refers to the conception ( garbhadhana) and the last to the funeral (crhjesh), while some of the impor. tact in&rsquo;en ening sacramects relate to the name-gung (rama karara) the tocsure ( cudakarra) tbe laitiation (uparia Fana), the end of studentsbup (som rorlara) and the marriage (traka) Apart from the popular and more or less superstitious parpose, which the sanskaras are supposed to serve, such as, for instance, the removal of es influences and attraction of favour able ones, they sene a very signifcant cultural purpose They represent, in a sense, the principal landmarks in the process of an individual developing icto a full-fledged social beio Atten tion may also be drawn to the fact that by prescribing th sarskāras for all classes of people - the only difference being that, among the lower classes, the surslaras are not accomp2pied by tte recitation of sected mantras-the Hinda thinlers have achieved a kind of unity and uniformity of their religious culture
If the scheme of the asraras represented a Lud of ethical Organization of an individual&rsquo;s personal life, the caste system could be regarded from a certain point of view, as the ethical organization of the social life of the Hindu Though caste is universally looked upon as one of the most distinctive features of Hinduism, it is, indeed, very difficolt precisely to define ciste All that we can do is to pdicate certam essential features of the caste system as it operates in India. To begin with, the member ship of a caste is determoed by birth Forther the caste normally regulates the marriage, diet, and occupation of the persons belonging to it. For instance, a caste is an endogamous group so that its members are forb dden to marry outside that caste in most cases a caste is further subdivided into smaller exogamous groups, the members of bich most pecessarily marry outside those groups It seems that the nigd restrictions on marriage, which of course, van according to different castes and localities, are due to the taboo on taking food cooked by or in

the company of certain persons As a matter of fact, according to some scholars, this taboo is the keystone of the whole caste system in this connection it must be pointed out that restric tions are placed by different castes also on the kind of food which may be taken by their members For most castes, again, there are fixed occupations Since heredity is the basic factor which invests an individual with a particular caste for life - unless, of course, he be later expelled from the caste for the violation of its rules - the transition from one caste to another becomes impossi ble Another important feature of the caste system is that there is some gradation of castes, whereby the Brāhmanas are generally assigned a position at the top Indeed, a casual observer might feel inclined to wonder whether the whole system did not revolve round the central theme of the prestige of the Brāhmanas Even the normal social intercourse among the various castes is governed by certain set regulations, many of which are based on ideas regarding pollution through direct contact or otherwise As a matter of fact the relative position of different castes in the hierarchy of the caste system has to be ultimately traced back to the conceptions of purity and magic potence in a ritual ceremonial Caste in India also implies the denial of certain civil and religious rights to a large number of people
A mention may be made of some other minor and less rigid restrictions Certain castes have special rights to wear certain ornaments or garments The kind of language to be used by one caste with reference to another is also sometimes determined by the status of those castes in the hierarchy Then there is the general ban placed on journeys overseas, presumably with a view to preserving the purity of caste which would otherwise be affected through contact with non caste people Provision is, however, made for expiatory rites in cases of violation of this ban It has been rightly observed that caste interferes with all the relations and events of the life of a Hindu, and with what precedes and follows it It has influenced the social process of India to such an extent that the caste of 1 Hindu persists even after he changes his religion The caste system is, accordingly, seen to

Hon did such a sistem come into baing? Several theories have been put forth as regards tbe origin and the growth of castes, Disision of society into classes or groups 15 perhaps a common feature all over the world But the caste system in India 1», as indicated above, peculiar in miny respects and so essentially incomparable suth the soc al segmentation seen elsewhere Some of the features of the Irdian caste sistem are indeed, so peculiar ibat, on account of them, it has to be distinguished from institu tions erting elsewhere, which are more or less analogous to it The usual ven about caste is that it is the result of the attempts of the culturally superior Aryan invaders to protect themselves from absorption by the barbarous aborigio-&gt; There 1further a tendency among many scholars to regard caste as an artificial creation of the priesthood - as an outcome of the minipulations of the Brahmanas to wanted to maintain the purity of the race of the Aryan invaders Those who adopt such a viet seem to forget that caste is essentially an organic growth rather than an externally imposed defensne measure Storeover, if re accept the exclasively racial origin of castes, we shall have satisfactonly to account for the circumstance that though colour prejudice and racial exclusiveness have been very common in history, they have not elses here given rise to an institution like caste Aod, further, will it be possible to claim that racial punity has beco actually preserved ampoog even de priestly casits of today?
To point to occupation as the exclusive basis of caste is equally uncooming Why should there hale been a taboo on commensality among different professions and hou could there hase arisen other strong prejudices among functional groups? A 119, which is non more commonly advanced, 13 that caste must be traced back to both racial and occupational origios It 15 suggested that colour or racial difference, real or fancied, together with hereditary occupations gave birth to the caste system, According to another sien, caste is the result of the impact of the patriarchal immigrants on the jodigenous matriarchal popu.

lation Some others define caste as a society of classes with a cross section of guilds There is indication in the Rgveda, which is the earliest literary document of the Indians, that the society in those days was organized into four distinct orders - Brāhmana (the poet-priest). Rājanva (the warrior ruler). Vaisya (the trader-agriculturist), and Sūdra (the labourer) In later litera tute these social orders are frequently referred to as Tarnas Tbe traditional theory is that castes owe their origin to these four varnas - being the result of mixed upions between the different varnas or between one varna and the offspring of such mixed unions 47 But to assume that the 3,000 castes, which are today 10 existence in India, are the outcome of such mixed unions is perhaps to put too great a strain on one&rsquo;s imagination This traditional attempt to explain caste is quite formalist and only shows that the origins of caste had then already become obscurc As a matter of fact such simple or set theories can hardly be expected to explain so bighiy complex a social phenomenon as the caste system
A proper appraisal of the ancient organization of the varnas would, however, lead to a better understanding of the later caste system It is sometimes suggested that the varna of ancient times is itself equivalent to caste On a closer examination, however, it will be found that the nature of Tarna was essentially different from that of caste as understood today Strictly speaking, caste Is pot varna, it is an In later times, yarna came to be loosely interpreted as caste presumably because the traditional theorists wanted to find, in the sacred Veda, authority for the caste system
A kind of religious sanction for caste was sought to be derived from the Purusa sakta&quot; wherein the four orders, namely, Bră hmana, Rājanya,&quot; Varya and Śūdra, are first mentioned It may be noted that the Purusa-Sülta does not use the word varna

There these orders are described as beiog respectuely, the mouth, the arms, the thighs, and the legs of the Cosmic Being The word sarna literally means colour, and there can be little doubt that in such passages in the Rgreda, bere this word 13 used in connection with the antagonism between the Aryan invaders (arja Farna) and the indigenous Indian tribes conquered by them (dāsa Tarna ), it denotes the colour of the skin It thus seems to emphasise the racial distinction between the early An 20 mm grants on the one hand, and all other tribes - collectively - whom they en ountered and wanquished, on the oth, When, however, the word Tarra is used to depote the four social orders, mentioned in the Purusa-sühia, it does not seem to possess any racial connotation whatsoever As a matter of fact these social orders are not even called tarnas in the Rgreda It is only in later Vedic Literatureal that the word rarna came to be first employed with reference to them in post-Vedic literature, particularly in the literature dealing with Hindu dharmasastra, the connotation of the word varna was further extended, and besides the four orders, it generally devoted also the castes, which had by that time, become consolidated :

It 15, indeed, suggested that all human communities were originally bodies of persons organized for ritual purposes, the chief of which was to secure a full life with sufficiency of whatever is necessary or desirable It thus seems that the division of the Vedic society into four orders was intended for properly distribut ing throughout the community the various duties connected with the communal ritual and thereby ensuring that those duties were performed only by persons who were duly qualified on account of the heredity, the purity preserved by means of taboos etc, and the knowledge of the special functions connected with the ritual The beginnings of the rigid regulations about taboo etc, which characterise the castes of the later times may be discovered in the magic-ritual origin of the Vedic iarnas One point, however, needs to be emphasised in this connection, namely, that, in the Vedic times, taboo and other restrictions possessed a definite reality, while, 10 later times, they were more or less conventionalized and thus became only the fossils of ancient ritual actualities It further appears that, with a view to distinguishing the ritual character and functions of the four orders, four distinct colours had been assigned to them - white to the Brāhmana, red to the Rūjanya or Ksatriya, yellow to the Vaisya, and black to the Śūdra 63 This fact would explain the significance of the name varna by which these orders came to be eventually known Traditionally these four colours were further associated with the points of the compass, which fact seems to radicate that, in order to avoid pollution through free contact, the four orders were allotted dwelling places in the four quarters within the communal settle ment The magic ritual character of the varnas is further con firmed by the concept of the ceremonial tubirth of the first three among them They were accordingly called dhijas or twice born It was only after the sacrament of initiation that they became qualified for their respective rilual functions She sarnas of the ancient times seem to have been, to some extent, fluid in character, and instances of transference of persons belonging to one iarna to another varna, though rare, are not altogether wanting This is

perhaps in keeping with the magic-ntcal ideology, which made it possible for a person, under special circumstances, to increase his magic-ritual potence and thus qualify bimself for functions diffe rent from those of his own order,
Thus, even in the Vedic times, there eusted a kind of delibe rate brerarchical organization among the Anan immigrants This organization included within itself certain factors, bich, on account of the interaction of certain other factors, so developed as to transform that organization into the caste system Indeed, one of the most significant features of the early Aryan conquest and colonisation, from the point of view of the social history of apcent India, may be said to have been the evolution of the foor ancient sarnas into the sanious later jares It is not sellaigh
possible to mark out the various stages in this process It may, however, be added that the drift of the evolution had been in the direction of hardening and secularization Presupably, among the indigenous communities of India also, there existed certain distinctive concepts of taboo, pollutiod, purification, etc Morcover there is sufficient ground to assume that their socia life was organized on the basis of graded fuoctional guilds The impact of the social orders of the Aryacs and the in digenous Indian communities on each other must bave helped the growth of castes Aad, besides the factors implied by these tuo social organizations, such as the ideas relating to mana or soul-stuff, taboo, pollution, ceremonial purity, and magic-ritual potence, tbe belief in magic associated with crafts and functions, the anxiety for guarding the secrets of trade, etc, several other factors, such as the geographical isolation of the Indian sub-con Linent, the enforcement of deliberate economic and administrative policies, the clash of cultures the fusion of races, the shrewd appli cation of the doctrine of harma, aed the tendency towards religi ous and social exploitation, must have further led to the consoli dation of these castes into a full fledged system. Such then was presumably the manner of the origia and the growth of castes As a matter of fact, except on the assumption of such a multiple origin, it is almost impossible to account for the extreme comple:

xity of the caste system The caste system in India, must, there fore, be regarded as a unique social institution in the world, for, #1 15, indecd, very rarely that the various factors, which have collectively contributed towards its building up, could be all found to subsist together in another region
Attention may be drawn at this stage to certain theoretical principles involved in the functioning of the caste system TO begin with it will be seen that, as a matter of fact, cach caste represents an independent social unit The different and exclu sive customs of a particular caste, in a sense, isolate it from other castes Therefore, though caste is a strong uniting force so far as its own members are concerned, it also serves as a potent dividing force vis-a-vis other castes Indeed, each caste seeks to guard its own special customs so jealously that one sometimes feels inclined to subscribe to the dictum that caste 15 custom But the peculiarity of the Hindu society is that it bas integrated several such independent units into an organic whole &ldquo;This social organism called the castc system, is so built up that it can accommodate within itself, without difficulty, any new unit that may come into existence Similarly, if one unit breaks up ioto smaller units, each one of the latter, instead of falling out, becomes naturally integrated into the bigger organism as an independently functioning cell
The exclusiveness and independence of a caste as a social unit Are further confirmed by its essentially autonomous character Each caste makes its ona rules and establishes its own customs It also possesses the power to enforce, through its council or panchayal, those rules and customs on its members The constr tution of these councils or panchayats varies in the case of different castes They are either permanent bodies or are impro vised for special occasions, and consist cither of hereditary functi onaries or of elected representatives The main or perhaps the only - sanction of caste rules and customs is excommunication from the caste - a contingency which a Hindu fears perhaps morc than anything else in the world in actual practice it is observed that the lower the caste in the social scale, the more efficient

are the organization and functioning of its council. It is suggen sted that the autonomous character of castes is sometimes vitiated by the fact tbat the ling or the state assumes the ultimate authority in respect of them There have no doubt beed cases wbere the rulers have exercised their power in the matter of a per son&rsquo;s expulsion from or restoration to his caste But all that the Hindu dharmasastra calls upon a king to do is to see that the rules and customs of a caste are being properly observed by its members It further requires him to tale care that his own law&rsquo;s are as far as possible compatible with the rules and customs of the various castes
In their original magic-ritual character, the varying status of the four social orders was perhaps not so ler, Seenly felt. All Sense of inequality must have been drowned into the ritual cere monial, through which they sought to achieve the common weal of the community and in which each of them bad a distioct and pecessary part to play But with the secularization of sarnas into astes, such gradation was bound to become more comples and pronounced Attempts were, therefore, made to palliate the Sense of inequality among castes and to rationalse the difference in the privileges and prerogatives enjoyed by persons belongog to different castes On the one band it was argued that castes were divine in orign, and, therefore, beyond the control of man On the other hand, the responsibility for the particular caste in which a person was bom was thrown on the person himself by suggesting that the actions done by an ipdividual in the preceding Ide detertained bus beredity and, therefore, caste in the next life Caste was thus regarded as a matter to be decided exclusively according to the external and inexorable law of karma It must, honever, he pointed out in this connection that the doctrine of karma not only justifies the present social status of an individual, it also offers a message of hope and sounds a note of warning. It emphatically lays done that an individual&rsquo;s nse or fall in the social scale in the next lfe depends entirely on the good or bad deeds which he performs in the present life with a view to cxtcouating the sense of inequality amoog casies, it is also argued92
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
that if the privileges of a higher caste are greater its responsibill. ties also are greater Further a reference may be made, in this context, to the fact that the allocation of a caste in the social scale is not necessarily rigid There is always the possibility and there have actually been instances of a caste ristag in the social scale by means of its own efforts A caste can, for instance, by changing or modifying its social and religious observances, generally improve its way of life so that its status in society is more or less automatically raised
Before concluding this section it is necessary to say a few words about the concepts of subcaste, mixed caste, and exterior caste It has been already pointed out that endogamy 1$ one of the chief characteristics of a caste The members of a caste are, accordingly, forbidden to marry outside that caste However, it often happens that, in the normal social process, a caste is divided into smıller groups, and the restrictions relating to endogamy and, in some cases, also those relating to commeosality and general social intercourse - come to be made applicable to each of these groups in a sense, therefore, each of these groups derives the character of a caste, and, for all practical purposes, is actually regarded as a real caste But, in view of the fact that they originate within a real caste and also that their status in the caste hierarchy as a whole is determined by the caste in which they originate, these groups are often referred to as subcastes The phenomenon of mixed or intermediate caste may be best described as the result of the attempts made by Hindu law givers to regularise the position of the progeny issuing from marriages forbidden by dharma and discountenanced by custom Though marriage within the caste was laid down as the legally recognised ideal, marriages outside the caste were not altogether unknown And, perhaps under the pressure of actualities, such unequal unions were not only taken into account by the law-givers, but, in a sense, were also condoned by them The Hindu theorists, accordingly, evolved a scheme pot so much for controlling such marriages as for systematising them Marriages of males of higher castes with females of lawer castes (anuloma vidha)
MAN IN HINDU THOUGHT
93
Fere viened with greater tolerance than marriages of females of higher castes with males of loner castes (praniloma virāka) It was, however laid done that the offspring of such unequal unions belonged peither to the caste of the father nor to that of the mother A Dew cadre of castes, called mixed or inter mediate astes, mas, therefore created the fact that these muted castes were not organic but nere artificial would become clear from the differences, which are quite apparent anong las gyers, in the matter of their nomenclature and legal rights and disabilities The genesis of the exterior castes, which are also koonp as outcastes or depressed castes has, on the other hand, to be traced back to the magic-ritual epoch rhen certain groups were debarred - purely on magic nitual grounds &ndash; from partici pating in the communal ritual either directly or indirectly Even in later times this stigma continued to be attached to these groups, and they, together with similar groups from among the sodigenous Indian communities, came to be assigned to an extremely low position in the social scale Theirs t», indeed, quite an anoma lous position They are not altogether disowned by the Hindu society, but, at the same time, they are kept outside the hieratic caste system while, therefore these groups are condemped to sofier all legal social and religious disabilities to shich a low class Hindu is normally subjected, they are also denied the few advaotages, at ch would have accrued to them had they belonged to the regular caste system. Really speaking these groups are casteless in the sense that Ibey are excluded from the caste system; but they are called astes, because, among themselves, they are divided into various smaller groups, which observe the uspal Testrictions relating to eodogamy commensality, and social intercourse Incidentally it may be added that the ignominious treatment reted out to these casteless castes by the caste Hindus has been perhaps ore of the most glaring inequities of the caste Systend

ties, actually came into being As indicated elsewhere, the Vedic society was divided into four orders - Brahmana, Rajanya, Vaisya, and Sūdra - which, strictly speaking, cappot be identified with castes in the sense in which we understand the term today This peculiar segmentation of society had as its basis the magic ritual functions which people had to perform in connection with the primitive communal sacrifice It was, therefore, necessarily influenced by all the peculiar concepts usually associated with such ritual, such as those relating to mana, taboo, polution by contact, capacity of food as the transmitter of magic power, etc The intercourse among these four orders was therefore, regulated in accordance with these concepts There did, no doubt, exist a kind of gradation among these social orders, but it was purely of a magic-ritual character These orders were not rigidly closed or exclusive groups In conformity with the magic ritual ideo logy, an upward or downward gradation was possible, though it could not have been quite frequent, because the principle of heredity soon begins to operate in matters where special functions or crafts are involved There are indications that the preeminence of the Ksatriya or Rājanya, among the four orders, was tradı tronally acknowledged perhaps because a representative of that order played the central role in the communal sacrifice How ever, in the Vedic literature, which is mainly the creation of poet priests, a conscious effort seems to have been made to glorify the function of the Brāhmana The function of the Vaisya was not clearly defined The first three orders were entitled to cere monal rebirth, which qualified them for direct participation 19 the ritual The Sūdra, who was regarded as untouchable so far as sacrifice was concerned, bad but an indirect share in it in addition to these four orders, mention is made, in the Vedic literature, also of certain occupations, like those of chariot-maker, barber, potter, etc, all of which seem to have origipated in a scheme for distributing, throughout the community, the various duties connected with the ritual There were also classes, Jike the Candilas, who seem to have been entirely debarred from participation in the communal ritual and so eventually formed the filth varna

As the result of a closer impact between the Aryan imml grants and the indigenous Indun communities, the Vedic yarnas tended to become more secular in character There are clear indi cations in the Brahmanic literature of the post-Vedic period that several closed groups were being formed in the society though they were all still included within the scheme of the four ancient orders The older gradation among the orders based on threr respective magic-ntual functions now hardened into general social Inequality, in which process the principle of bereditv played the most prominent role The position of the Brāhmanas as the specially privileged class was finally confirmed, and, correspond ingly, the Sūdras came to be degraded and suffered from several disabilmes in religious and secular matters The Ksatriyas were struggling to retain their original position of prelminesce, and the Vasyas were slosly but surely sinking in the social scale The various occupational groups nere generally assigned either to the Vaista farra or the Sudra rarna This stratification of society became so rigid that, la course of time in every single mitter, big or small - from the scales of taxation to the mode of address and salutation, from the age of 10tation to the location of crema tion-grounds - the distinction of ore varna from another and the gradation in their status were emphatically bronght out The most complete and detailed picture of this social pattern with all its ramifications is to be found in the Vanusmrti (cir 2nd century BC)51 bich has laid down that obedience to caste rules (varnadirma) was the very essence of dharma The scheme of varnas thus finally consolidated itself into a full-fledged caste system, which, with its compler variety of real castes sobcastes, mixed castes, right-band castes and left-hand castes, and exterior castes, has dominated the Hindu social life through the ages. The aggrandizement of the bigher caste at the cost of the lower caste, accordingly, continued to be the motive force of Hinda social organization.

system, but without any tangible result Neither Buddhism nor Islam can be said to have done much in the matter of the exter mination of castes In more recent times, Kapılar (Tamil), Vemana (Telugu), Basava (Lingāyata), Kabırpanthis, and Sikhs - among others &ndash; strongly opposed caste But in the case of some of them the poison of caste recoiled on them, while the protests of the others proved sterile Theoretically the British could not have had any sympathy for the caste system But as rulers they were too shrewd directly to jaterfere with any of the social institutions prevailing in India Whenever, however, they found that some features of the caste system were likely to affect their principal aim, namely, to stabilise their power in this country they did not remain indifferent about it. For instance, they laid down that their own law would, under all circumstances, Override the laws of the various caste councils Similarly they refused to recognise the right of the Brahmanas to act as priests to all castes of the Hindus Some acts like the Special Marriage Act, which were aimed at neutral sing caste restrictions, were no doubt passed in the British regime, particularly as the result of the incessant work done in that behalf by certain Hindu legislators There was also the pressure of the new reformist movements But, on the whole, the British cannot be said to have achieved much 10 the matter of counteracting the evils of caste On the contrary, in many ways caste system proved helpful to their policy of divide and rule

The fact that the sponsors of the reformist movements in modern India have made aaste the main target of their attack against Hindu practices is likely to lead one to think that caste System has not played any useful role whatsoever in the coltoral history of lodia. It should, however be remembered that it is the institution of aste which bas enabled diverse elements of population in India to Ire together in a more or les organized form In ancient times, for instance, this social device had been mainly instrumental in regulatag and regulanising the racial fusion between the Aryan immigrants and the indigenous lodian communities Esen in later Indian history there have been sere ral instauces of foreigners being assimùated spto the Hindu fold, almost as a matter of course, through the agency of castes The facts relating to the ongn and the present status of the Rajputs are perhaps most signiblant in this respect But it is not only that the caste system, by evolving an organic shole out of diverse elements, minimised - or, in some cases, completely neutralized - the serious consequences of the social upheasal, which normally follows in the spate of the encounters of various races and peoples What is perhaps more significant is that, while doing so, it say to it that the individual cultures of those races and peoples were not adversely affected. If, today, Hindam is truly a federation of cultures, the credit for it must belong tot in a small measure, to the aste system in the cultural history of India the caste system has proved a great integrating and stabr Lising force it is, hou eser, decessary to add, in this connection, that the caste system Deser encouraged racial promicuity On the contrary, through its rigid rules regarding endozamy and exogamy, it sought to presene what is known in genetics as &lsquo;pore line

These are some of the items which can be shown to the credit of the caste system In the final accounting, however, it is the debit side which is likely to prove heavier Whatever the factors that were responsible for the genesis of caste, there can be hardly any doubt that, in the course of its consolidation, it turned out to be the very antithesis of the principle of the essential equality of men But what was perhaps still worse was that, by accepting heredity as the only criterion which determined one&rsquo;s caste, the caste system completely blocked the way for individual pro gress Whatever his ability and attainment, an individual could not even think of being up-graded in the social scale during his life time The doctrine of karma could be but a poor consolation under such circumstances The caste system is often credited - not, of course quite unjustifiably - with having afforded consi derable security to its members But for this they had to pay a heavy price Members of a caste are compared to cogs in a wheel which protected them only when they completely subordinated themselves to it
The caste system gave rise to still more serious social evils As indicated above it implied the denial of certain cıyıl and reli gious rights to a large number of people Having created and stabilised social inequality, which was necessarily accompanied

by oppression and exploitation of one class by another, the caste system proved a constant source of discontent apd unrest, and, consequently, a perennial obstruction to social progress The extreme social segmentation naturally presented the grosth of the sentiment of national poity Patriotism was not unoften misunderstood as loyalty to ope&rsquo;s caste, and the interests of the caste- and not of the community as a whole - became the motive force in social lfe True morality was superseded by the demands of caste roles Forther, batas beneficial in the initial stages of the economic life prosed to be quite the contrary 10 course of time Restriction on the choice of occupation, for instance, led to unemployment within a caste, abile absence of competition among castes in respect of production and trade killed all initiatrse and enterprise
The attitude towards caste, today, is mainly threefold. Firstly, there are some people who believe that the caste system is the creation of god, that it is governed by the inetorable lan of karma, that it still has its uses, and that, therefore, it must not be-oay, it cannot be - supplanted under any circumstances, This view is too reactionary in the context of the conditions at present presailing in Jodia to deserve any serious consideration. Then there are others who would like to see the present 3,000 or more castes grouped together into the four social orders mention ed in the Purusa-sūkta, namely, Brahmana, Rajanya, Vabya, and Śūdra - these latter being allowed to preserve the main features of the caste system It will be easily seen ibat such a substitution of the four rarnas for the dumerous jātus is now neither possible nor desirable Finally there are social reformers who advocate a complete extermination of castes by all possible means It is now fully realized that, despite geographucal, climatic, racial, reh gious, and linguistic diversities, India possesses a fundamental cultural unity and continuity The caste system, which may hale once been a great integrating and stabilising force, is now proving a serious menace to that sense of upity It is rightly poicted out that the gravest exit of the caste system is that it Las rendered lodian society undemocratic and a sociological

myth One, therefore, feels inclined strongly to support the plea that an active nation wide campaign be launched against caste, both through governmental and primitive agencies in this connection it is necessary to remember that, even in the past, cfforts were occasionally made to supplant caste On account of its peculiar vitality, the system has endured in the face of all revolts against it Even today we see great loyalty being evinced to the system, even by the lower and the suppressed classes Every campaign against caste must, therefore be based on a correct estimate of the real source of its vitality
It is also necessary to remember that conditions in modern India are changing rapidly The very pressure of the new set of circumstances bas helped to minimise the operation of many fea tures of the caste system The present economic set-up, for instance, is fast killing the occupational character of castes The growing facilities of and increasing necessity for communi cation among various people have effectively neutralized the restrictions relatiog to commensality and social intercourse It 18 found that the observance of the rigid rules regarding pollution through contact etc is now well nigh impossible in the ordinary day to day life It may be enforced only in ritual situations Further, several basic concepts of the so called philosophy of caste, such as its divine origin and its efficacy to preserve racial purity, are now completely discountenanced It may also be pointed out that the movement of bhaktı has done much in uniting the various castes into a sort of religious democracy
There is, however, one feature of the caste system which seems to die hard, namely, its control over marriage Even an educated Hindu who claims freedom in the matter of food, social intercourse, occupation, travel, etc is seen to observe scrupu lously the matrimonial rules of caste it is suggested that this last stronghold of the caste system can be most effectively attacked only through inter caste marriages on the widest scale This 18 perhaps to beg the question Very little, indeed, can be achieved in the matter of the extermination of castes unless some radical change is effected in the economic system, which now lies at thc

root of all social relationships At any rate, it is most reassuring to find it laid down in the Constitution of the Indian Republic, which, indeed, represents the collective will of the people of India, that &ldquo;the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them &quot; and that &ldquo;untouchability is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden&rdquo;
It has been rightly pointed out that one of the most outstand log paradores of Hinduism is that it gives one absolute liberty in the world of thought but enjoins upon him a strict code of conduct Whatever, therefore, might be the philosophical assevera tions of a Hindu, he would consider conscientious observance of the asramadharma and the varnadharma - more particularly of the latter - to be a duty of prime importance Thus is indeed, ma sease, as it should be Practice coscerns the whole mass of the people. Therefore, without their contorming to some disciplined and well-regulated way of life, the solidanty and stability of the Society would be dificult to achieve On the other hand, in the matter of higher thought, with wuch but a select few were really concerned, there could not be any risk in allowing those few com plete freedom As a matter of fact history shows that such freedom in belief and thought hus, more often than not, proved conducive to general progress it is necessary to add, in this connection, that, while strictly conforming to the practice, ode most not, as far possible, lose sight of the spirit underlying that practice That is, however what seems to have happened 10 respect of the aśramadharma and the varnadharmo in course of time, there developed a sort of gull between the original concept and the actual practice
Besides the āśramadharma and the varnadharma, the Hindu theorists speak of four other kinds of dharma oamely, the varnāšramadharma or the dharma applicable to 40 individual of a particular varna at a particular stage in his personal life, the gunadharma or the dharma which concerns some distinct office or position held by an individual, the numitta-dharma or the dharma which refers to certain special curcumstances, and102

the sämänyadharnia or general ethics A few observations may be made here relating only to this last kind of dharma It must be pointed out, at the very outset, that the general Hindu ethics cannot be said to have been reduced to any regular code as such For, as in metaphysics so in ethics, the Hindu seems to place greater emphasis on the inculcation of a proper attitude of mind rather than on the postulation of any elaborate theories For instance, the theoretical question as to whether human will is free or pot does not seem to have particularly bothered a Hindu All that he sought to do was to neutralize his will completely through mystic union with the Supreme Being
So far as what may be called the practical side of Hindu ethics is concerned, one is, first of all, reminded of the three cardı nal virtues enumerated in an interesting payable of tbe Brhadāra yaka-Upanisad 6 Gods, men, and demons are said to have once gone to their comnon father, Prajāpats, and requested him to instruct them To gods, Prajapati communicated the syllable da, which they correctly understood to be the symbol of the instruction, dāmyata,&rdquo; practise self control&rdquo; To men also, Prajapati communicated the syllable da, which ibey understood 10 the sense, dalta &ndash;&ldquo;practise charity&rdquo; To demons, likewise, Prajāpati communicated the syllable da, which, in their case, denoted dayadlvam - practise compassion” The Upanised further tells us that all beings are frequently reminded of this triple instruction of Prajāpati relating to the three cardinal virtues of self control (dama ), charity (dana),59 and compassion (dayā) through the thundering of clouds which produces the sound da da da The Bhagavadgitā has mentioned, in different contexts quite a large number of other virtues, such as, for instance, fearlessness ( abhaya), purity of mind ( sath asamsuddhi), sacrifice (Jajna), uprightness (ārjaya), nop violence (ahımsa), truth (sarja ), freedom from anger (akrodha), renunciation

56 The word charity is not used in the sense of merely giving alms It rather implics sharing what one has with one&rsquo;s fellow beings, not being sellish, and, therefore, loving one&rsquo;, fellow beings

(trāga), tranquility (arn), aversion to fault-finding (opaisuna), freedom from covetousness (aloluparra), gentleness (mārdara), modesty (hr), and steadicess (acapala) 57 It also enjoias on man the avoidance of certaio vices – more particularly of lust (härra), anger (krodha), and greed (lobha), which represent the &lsquo;triple gate of hell&rsquo;, leading to the run of the soul * The Huda concept of sin is, indeed, very comprebensive and includes withm itself several views expressed on different plages-from the most primitive view which represents sin as a disease to the most elevated one huch represents it as the denial of soul or betrayal of self, some of the other views berog those which regard sm as debt or as breach of caste rules, or as defiance of god, or as being out of harmony with the spintual eartronmeots, or as lack of spiritual power It will be thus seen that the general practical ethics of the Hirdus is much the same as that of the Lost of the civilised peoples But if the Hindus have anywhere distinguished themselves it is in their special emphasis on truth (santo), con-violence ( ahimsā), sacrifice (Jajfia), and renuncia tion ( sam āsa ), which, according to them, are not merely passive virtues, but represent positive social morality
Very little need be said about truth. Attention may only be drawn to the Upaniadic parable about Satyakāma Jābūla. When asked about his antecedents by his teacher, Satyalāma gave a straightforward reply that he did not really know from wbat family he had come, but that he only knehis mother&rsquo;s Dame, and that she had told him that she did not know from
bat father be was born herself having led a very santop life in ber youth On accouot of this pure aod unadulterated truth told by him, the son of Jabālā was forthwith accepted by the teacher as a worthy pupu for spiritual instruction This parable emphasues that truthfulness 15 to be recognised as the only criterion of an individuals character and position As for ahımsā, it is the cosmic outlook of the Hindus which teaches

them to respect all life - Indeed, all god&rsquo;s creation This is the positive aspect of ahimsa Closely allied with this is the teaching regarding armaupamya, that is, seeing with equality everything in the image of one&rsquo;s own self,co and sarvabhūtahita, that is, doing good to all creatures 61 It 18, indeed, well said that the doctrine of ahımsā, with its host of implications, is of far greater importance than the costliest philanthropic institutions The concept of sajñia must be said to be dominating the entire Hindu view of life The form and extent of sacrifice may have varied from age to age but its underlying spirit, expressed in the words, &quot; fostering each other you shall attain to the supreme good&quot;,&amp;* has endured throughout The Bhagavadgita, indeed, describes the whole upiverse as a &ldquo;wheel of sacrifice &ldquo;93 which operates of the ethical principle of mutual interdependence among its constituents No one must be remiss in playing bis appointed part in that sacrifice, lest the proper functioning of the world would be adversely affected
The concept of samnyása (renunciation in Hinduism has been very much misunderstood It is often suggested that samnjäsa is a negative virtue, that it is not a social value, and that a samnjāsın has no social personality It cannot be denied that the actual practice of samnyasa in popular Hinduism gave sufficient ground for such characterisation But the true ideal in this respect is represented in the Bhagavadgitā, which reconciles samnyasa with the ideal of lokasamgraha ( solidarity of the society and maintenance of the universe) and the doctrine of yajña A true samjásın is one who practises renunciation in action and and not of action The Bhagavadgitā, indeed, lays down in the following words the motto, which, according to Hinduism, should govern the role of man in relation to the world “There fore, without attachment, perform always the work that has to be done, for man attains to the highest by doing work without attachment” (First published ABORI 43, 1963, 1-57 )

<p>It is now generally agreed that man is basically &amp; religious creature As a finite beisg, he instinctively yearns for the infinite Actually he seeks in the Infinite the solace and support for his ono finite life As the Chandogja-Upanisad says! Jo vai bhima tai sulham, ra’lpe sulham astı It is, indeed, the potential infinity in his finite personality &ndash; his instinctive urge to transcend the finiteness from which he suffers - that produces 10 man what ray be called a religious feeling
And the most basic factor in this religious feeling may be said to be a vague sense of some power which permeates and directs man and the uonerse The doctrine relating to this power is represented by the historidas as religion under various nanes, such as adimism, manaism, aumenism, dynamism, and theism. Ao extedsion of this doctrine, which has evoked perhaps the largest consensus, is the claim that the belief in god constitutes the primary priociple of all religions But can such a claun be said to hold good in respect of Hioduism?
It must be confessed, at the very outset, that it is not possible to make any statement shich may be generally applicable to Hinduism as a whole For, Hinduism is by no means a homoge neous entity Sectaninism is the very essence of Hinduism, and, when any general statement regarding Hioduism is made, one or the other of its sects is bound to prove an exception to that statement This is, indeed, quite understandable in respect of a relgion which has arisen and developed without Prophet, without Book, and without Church Hinduism is not made, it has grown It is well and truly said that Hinduism is a jungle and not a deliberately laid out park or garden Whatever could GTON ID it did actually grow in it The doctrines and practices or Hinduism can, accordingly, 11 lend themselves to any cute gene

ralization All that one may seek to do is to view the entire situation historically and synoptically
For our present purpose, the history of Hinduism may be conveniently divided into four periods, namely, (1) the period of the pre-Vedic non-Aryan religious complex, wbich is basically different from Vedism but whose affiliations with the classical or historical Hinduism are beyond doubt and essentially organic and thus establish a line of direct development with it, and which may, therefore, be justifiably characterised as proto-historical Hipduism, (2) the period of the Vedic interlude with its distinct mythology, magic, ritualism, and spiritualism, (3) the period of classical or historical Hinduism jo its stages of consolidation and proliferation, and (4) the period of the stagnation of Hinduism and its subsequent confrontation with modernity?
The sources of our knowledge of proto-lustorical Hinduism are necessarily limited We do not possess any literature or popular tradition directly relating to that period, and all that we have to draw upon consists of archaeological finds and other similar antiquities It is, however, possible to sketch jo broad butline the salient features of the religious situation prevailiog in the pre-Vedic non Aryan period of India&rsquo;s history with the help of the archaeological and allied evidence as also with the help of the literary reflexes of that situation seen in the later Vedic and other texts The principal god of that period was represented variously in different parts of the country-as Pasupatı-Yogi Svara of the Indus people, as the red god Sivan of the Proto Dravidians, as Sarve of the eastern people, and as Bhava of the Vähikas or Bählykas He was the supreme male god associated With the cult of the Mother Goddess or the Mothers &quot; who presumably personified that god&rsquo;s power of procreation and sustenance The proto historical Hinduism was an idolatrous religion, the god having been worshipped in the form of an image or a carved figure or some other concrete symbol The existcoce

of public places of Worship also cannot be discountedanced The norship took the form of pújā, which basically consisted of anointing the figure or the symbol of the god normally with the blood of the animal offered to him or otherwise with some suitable substitute The offering to the god, which often formed part of a communal sacrifice, was usually raw and was made over to the divi Dity directly - that is to say, it was of the nature of balı and not of the nature of homa wherein the oblation was usually cooked and was offered to the divinity through sacral fire On account of the pouring of blood over the figure or the symbol of the god, the god looked red and was, in some parts of the country, actually called Siva meaning &ldquo;red god * Even the worshippers of that god put sacramental blood on their bodies, or otherwise painted their bodies red or more red robes Yoga, penance and auste aties, wandering mendicancy, ecstatic conditions engendered through special medicaments, control and peculiar operation of the vinle poser, etc, constituted some of the main factors of the proto-historical Hindu religious pracuce These factors very markedly differenuated the pre-Vedic qod-Anan religious culture of the munus and jars from the Vedic Arap religious culture of the r515 But fairly distinct echoes of the former can be heard in some Vedic hymns like the Juni-sük ta (RP X. 136 ), the Brah macari-sükta ( AV XI ), and the Vratza-sūklas (AV XY) In vies of the fact that most of the significant features of this proto historical Hinduism are seen to have been preserved, consolidated, and developed in the later Srva-religion, the former may very well be characterised as the religion of proto-Sıva Vedic Rudra is but an Agad version of that god *
This reconstruction of the proto-bustoncal Hinduism, which was bound to be but cursory, cannot, however, be said sufficicotly to enlighten us on the total conception of godhead so that penod All that we are entitled to presume is that, if we visualized the later Sıva-religion as an essentially monotheistic religion, we might

obtain a fairly suggestive glimpse in the proto-historical Hindu theology
With Vedism, a new religious ideology, which is exotic and basically distinct from the proto-historical Hindu religious ideo logy, -makes its appearance on the Indian scene Fortunately, from this period onwards, we have a rich and almost unbroken tradition of religious literature, which enables us to study more specifically the topics which are pertinent to our present inquiry, such as the nature of the deity, the relation of the deity to the world, and the relation of the deity to the finite self in its three principal states, namely, the pre-samsára state, the embodted state, and the emancipated state
To begin with the Rgreda, one may say that that Veda is &ldquo;primarily occupied with mythology rather than with theology
To pot it in other words, most of the Rgvedic gods appear to have been created for the myths and not the myths created for the gods The Rgvedic religion is directly dependent on myths The myth is the primary and unique mode of apprehending reality, it is thus expressive of the primitive man&rsquo;s experience of reality The myth, indeed, is the thing, while the divinities seem to have been thought of as mere actors in the mythological drama In the course of the exuberant growth of mythology and mythology, it should be remembered, is an essentially grow 10g phenomenon- many incidental and sometimes even irelevant details are added to its nucleus It is in view of this tendency that mythology is said to be telling many little lies in the interest of one great truth &quot;
It is generally accepted that the Vedic gods are not amenable to being reduced to any kind of system The character of the Vedic gods, as imagined by the Vedic poets in different contexts, is too fluid and jptangible And this their feature gets more and more confirmed on account of the absence of any attempt, during that period, to represent them in a concrete manger A sculpture or a painting certainly tends to invest a god with a kind of definite characterisation Strictly speaking, a Vedic god is

109
generally not a god in the spiritual, moral, or mystical sense He 15 venly a bundle of epithets and functions But even in this respect we do not find any logical consistency Whatever theism there is in the Veda is little more than glorified anthropomor phism, which latter, again, is bighly variable The Vedic divities would seem to defy any classification - bether regional, rtua lite or functional They are too vague and impersonal for such classification. In this connection, BARVETT actually went to the extent of saying that the Vedic people whose imagination created Vedic deities had never felt any deep interest in them and that the Vedic poet-priests had got been able to cover them with the flesh and blood of living personality
Notwithstanding all this, attempts have been made to discover some norm or derile some system by means of an analysis of Vedic mythology The Mirulia of Yaska refers to the theones of scholiasts like the Nauruktas, the Aitihasikas, and the Yamikas The etymological-naturalistic interpretation of Vedic mythology, sponsored by Yáska, found a large following among the modern Vedists They were content to look upon myths as a kind of paraphrase of natural phenomena, for them, Vedic mythology was latile rrore than &ldquo;a plastic and popular physics and astro nomy &quot; It is hardly necessary to emphasize the inherent inade quacy of such a view Suffice it to point out that it has bot inevitable that the religious thinking of the Vedic people, who lived in immediate contact with pature, should have been pro foundly influenced by naturalistic concepts but those concepts cannot be said to bale constituted the basic foundation of their religious thinkisg Naturl phenomena generally do got create mayths aod legends, the similarity with a natural phenomenon may only help mythologically to reinforce a story which often has a real historical happening for its b3sts

may be made here to some of the typical views in this connection MAX MULLER, for instance, begins with certain basic assump tions According to him, all religions have some common basic elements, such as the realisation of the Divine in the actual, the feeling of human weakness and dependence, the faith in the divine ordering of the world, the consciousness of good and bad, and the hope for a higher and better life Again, all religions, howsoevermuch they may differ in other respects, agree 10 onc point, namely, that their evidence is not entirely supplied by sensuous perception in connection with this, MAX MUILER thinks that, so far as the Vedic religion is concerned, two factors must have been operative (1) some kind of external revelation as is suggested by the word śruti and (2) a kind of religious instinct, which only man, among all living creatures, possesses He then goes on to point out that, by a simple psychological analysis, we can discover three classes of things, which we can perceive with our senses, but which leave in us three very distinct kinds of impression of reality (1) tangible objects, such as stones, shells, and bones, which are supposed to have been the earliest objects of religious worship by the religion historians who bold fetishism 10 be the first beginnings of all religion, (2) semi tangible objects, such as trees, mountains, rivers, the sea, and the earth, and (3) mangible objects, such as the sky, the stars, the Sun, the dawn, and the moon The testimony of the Veda, MAX MULLER further points out, shows that, out of the three foregoing classes of objects, the first is hardly represented at all among the so called deities of the Rgveda As for the semi tangible objects, each one of them can be met with among the deities of the Veda MAX MULLCR characterises these deities as semi deilies in the intangible objects can be discovered the germs of what may be called full deities MAX MULLER&rsquo;S conception of Vedic mythology is naturalistic, and in his matura listic conception hic scems always to stress the solar aspectI{crc it is neither possible nor necessary to subject MAI MULLER&rsquo;S

views to any critical examination, it may only be pointed out that the facts of Vedic mythology as stated by him are often correct, but his interpretation of them is not always convincing
The startiog poput of BERGAIGNE IS the assumption of the rigorous zaterdependence of Vedic mythology and Vedic cult? The sacrificial ritual is according to him, the true reproduction on earth of the cosmic phenomena. These phenomena are of two kinds (1) those which accompany the rising of the son ( solar phenomena ), and (2) those which accompany the fallsng of ram after a long drought (meteorological phenomena) la both these kinds of phenomena, Vedic mythology disticgaishes between male and fecale elements, and these different elements are represented differently in the frame-work of mythological anthropomorphisco and zoomorphism From this bare sketch of BERGAIGVES theory it would be seen that, tbough SERGAIGNE started with a vien to presenting Vedic religion and mythology as a simple system consisting of a fen easily intelligible formulas, he actually ended by producing only a complicated and essentially schematic pattern
Rudolf OTTO approaches the Veda pot from the point of view of philology or Indology, but from the point of 11ew of psychology and history of religion&rdquo; He believes that the genesis of the Vedic gods (1odeed, of any gods) angot be traced back to the effects produced on man s mind by the great phenomena of nature, soch as the sun, the sky, the stone, the winds, etc, but that, at the bottom of all consciousness of drypity, there is the specific and a prion faculty of apperception of a power shich may best be termed as a pimen' It wil, however, be easily agreed that Vedic mythology 15 too comprehensive and variegated to be squeezed into the narrow frame of the Duminous

far as the Vedic religion and mythology are concerned, the two antithetical yet complementary divine rulers Mitra and Varuna are the representatives of the class of priests, Indra (or Vāyu) of that of warriors, and Asvins of that of food-producers DUMÉ ZIL is rightly criticised for being &quot; carried away by his own hypotheses, constructions, and subjective interpretations &quot; 10
My own view is that Vedic mythology is essentially an evolutionary mythology Its general character has changed 10 accordance with the vicissitudes in the cultural life of the Vedic people For instance, it would be seen that a certain specific god was regarded as having been sovereign and supreme in a certain specific period The reason for this was that the character and personality of that god were in full conformity with the ethos of that period This is one aspect of the evolutionary mythology The other aspect of it is that, though the basic character of a divinity was determined by the peculiar environments in which it had come into beipg, that character did not remain static and stagnant throughout It underwent various modifications in accordance with the changing conditions of life of the Vedic Aryans in the course of its evolution, many new features gradually accumulated round that divinity so that the total personality which it finally presented was highly complex 1, however, believe that it is not altogether impossible to analyse the complex character and personality of a Vedic god, generally isolate from one another the various elements in that character, and then broadly mark out, with the help of comparative mytho

logy, anthropology, and the cultural history of the Vedic Arvans, the different stages 10 the evolution of that god
I should like to characterize the primar ard the most basic religious concept in the early Vedic period as Orendism or Asuism The Vedic man believed in a magc potence- and be often thought of it 12 terms of scmething like “soul-stuff&rdquo;. which permeated through gatore and the human world and thereby constituted the essential basis of their existence and functioning This magic potence has shared alike by gods, human beir, animals trees, etc - of course in varying propor tions It was on account of this that the Vedic man made do sharp distinction between spint and matter, Imog and lifeless, person and thung abstract and concrete, substance and attributes, etc The concept of a somatic magic potence such as this tas, mdeed, common to the religious ideologes of many primitive peoples The name for this potence, which is particularly pope lar with the anthropologists, is Maps or Orenda, and its Vedic counterpart, in my view, 15 as: It is from these names that I have coined the terms Orendism and Asvism The Vedic man further believed that, through his marfra and cultic action, new asu could be created and the existitg asu either enhanced or reduced or traosferred from one entity to another The essential cature of the Vedic gods is that they are asuras or special possessors of the asu-potence varura is asura par etcellence and soften celebrated, in the Agreda, as the samrāl, who, by virtue of his power of bondage arisiog from his asuratsa, esta blishes the cosm c order na in this vast and complex 005 serse This may be said to be the norm of the cosmic myth which is presented in the Veda ja varying forms and with different gods in different contents The Vedic poet-prest speaks of several other aspects of this essential magic putru, o sbose operation man is believed to be subjected either positively or Degatively The Vedic poet priest further emphasizes the fact that, while man is dependent for his existence and functioning on the bearers of the magic asu-potence (assras) the latter too are dependent for their proper functioning on man&rsquo;s mantra and
114
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
cultic action This sense of mutual interdependence may, indeed, be said to be at the very root of the cosmic ethics of the ancient Indians
&lsquo;To recapitulate So far as the primary conception of god. head of the early Vedic poet-priests is concerned, three points need to be specially stressed, namely, (1) that the Vedic gods are generally conceived as being subservient to an all pervading magic potence, (2) that, since they participate in this magic potence together with all other categories of existence, they cannot be said to be essentially distinct from the latter (the potence being more basic and more important than the person&rsquo; or &lsquo;thing&rsquo; in which it inheres), and (3) that all these categories, including gods, are dependent on one another for their proper functioning This, in brief, is the only theology that one can derive from the Rgieda Everything else is mythology Apart from the primary cosmic myth, which has been referred to above, the most signifi cant of the factors which have become operative in the process of the evolution and growth of Vedic mythology are mythologisation of history mainly through the superimposition of naturalistic cosmic elements (as represented in the Indra legends) and hierarchisation of popular religious cults, wherein solarization bas played a particularly prominent role, (as, for instance, seen in the evolution of the mythology relating to Visnu and Pūsın)
Theologically, the religion of the Rgieda may be characterised as &ldquo;pan asuism&rdquo;, if I am permitted to coin such a word to denote the religious doctrine according to which the universe conceived as a whole is asu-permeated But, mythologically, that religion is certainly polytheistic It is a polytheism of anthropomorphic character A few pertinent points need to be taken into account in this context The anthropomorphism of the Vedic gods, it will be seen is itself highly variable Again, properly speaking, there is no hierarchy among these gods There are no clear and well defined functions in the world process and world rule assigned to the various members of the Vedic pantheon As a matter of fact, one may hardly speak of a pantheon of Vedic gods in the strictest sense of the term They do not have any recognised

undisputed leader like Zeus or Jupiter, and they present a picture of “interminable variety of ranks and confusing interchange of characters * In view of these facts, the Rgvedic polytheism must be said to be a diffuse polytheism
It is suggested that one may discover in the Rgreda a distinct trend of its polytheism gradually making way to mono. theism For one thing there is noticeable an acreasing tendency to identify the gods one with another, which MAX MULLER calls syncretism The frequent grouping of gods also points in the same direction Then there are suggestions that all Vedic divinities are participants in the same divine esserce Further, the Vire L&rsquo;esīh are regarded as embodying the concept of collective godhead, and a fer passages from the Rgseda are beltered to reflect a kind of &ldquo;integral multiplicity in the d une world In spite of all such indications it must be clearly stated that monotheism in the sense of a single ethical god s bo, while being intimately involved in the world process is yet transcen dental in character had not developed in the Vedic penod. Indeed, such monotheista cannot be said to have developed jo any period of the history of Hinduism, except perhaps in the proto-historical perod Whatever jpdications there are in the Veda point to nopism rather than to monotheisio For instance, the oft-quoted Rgvedıc passage (t 167 46 ), cham sad riprå bahudhà rodanti, cannot be said to imply monotheisio The peuter elam and the fact that the manifold forms of that one principle are stated to have been accepted as an established fact would go agaiast such an interpretation In the creative process of tbe voiverse, the many issues out of the &ldquo;ode', in the thuoking process of man, on the other band he seeks to reduce the many' to the one. It is this latter trait which is often misrepresented as suggesting monotheism
c. A his treatment of Vedic religion, MAT MULLER has emphasized one significant tendency of the Vedic poets, namely, to celebrate jodividual gods successively as the highest To this successive belief in single supreme gods te has given the care of
116
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
henotheism or kathenotheism 11 To identify Indra, Agni, and Varuna is one thing, it is syncretism To address either Indra or Agni or Varuna as, for the time being, the only god in existence with an entire forgetfulness of all other gods is quite another - According to MAX MUI LER, it is this latter tendency, the heno theistic tendency, which is fully developed and predominantly reflected in the hymns of the Rgreda MAX MULLER further adds that henotheism marks a stage between the original poly theism and the later monotheism of the Rgxeda
OLDENBERG characterizes benotheism as an appearance rather than a reality, for, as he seeks to point out, such successive glorification of the Vedic gods has a reference to different sacrificial contexts and thus has little theological value 12 BLOOM FIELD also explains the phenomenon of henotheism on ritualistic grounds and adds that henotheism is “polytheism grown cold in service, and unnice in its distinctions, leading to an opportunist monotheism in which every god takes hold of the sceptre and none keeps it &quot; 13 The protagonists of Urmonotheism (that 15, of the doctrine that belief in one single god is primary in all religions) are inclined to regard henotheism as deteriorated monotheism According to Rudolf OTTO the so called heno. theism only indicates that certain Vedic tribes worshipped certain gods as their special gods and placed them above others It is just a case of tribal (or, as HILLEBRANDT would put it, regional) monolatry It is also suggested by some scholars that the same mental attitude as inspired the dānastutis (or eulogies of patrons) also inspired henotheistic hymns That is to say, blatant flattery was at the bottom of those hymos
It may, first of all, be pointed out that the tendency observed by MAX MUILER is an indisputable fact of Vedic mythology His suggestion that the Vedic religious thought has developed from polytheism through henotheism to monotheism is also probable, but it actually did not happen that way, for, the Vedic

religion dever became monotheistic To speak in the coatext of henotheism, of various monotheisms or of monotheisms with changing gods is theologically UpSound The conception of Urmonotheism does not seem to be valid at least so far as the Vedic religion is concerned. The Vedic tendency, as mentioned earlier, 15 to go from the many &lsquo;to the &lsquo;one&rsquo; and oot vice versa Henotheism cannot, therefore, be explained as the last remem brance and relic of the original monotheism Similarly, there is no evidence to support the assumption that henotheism 15 either a ntualistic device or a tribal trait. To compare henotheistic passages with dānastutis amounts to a gross Disconception of both. Henotheism is certainly not intended merely for the practical purpose of fattering certain god, with a ver to garding treasures from then Henotheism represents a distract religious attitude, namely, that of eclecticism (as against absolutism or exclusivism ) which has characterised Hiodoism almost throughout its history 11 Its further development may be traced to the concept of 1sfaderatá which implies a complete freedom of choosing one&rsquo;s special god and mode of worship, without however, allowing that freedom to become in any way detrimental to other gods and other forms of worship Monotheism is essentially exclusive in character Accordingly, benotheism is not only not a stage leading towards monotheism, but, in a sense, it implies an opposition to it One could claim that one&rsquo;s god was supreme, but one must not claim that that god sas unique It may be incidentally added that it is the two doctrices, namely, of adhikara (spuntual competence) and of Istaderată (freedom of worship ), wbuch have helped to brag about a kind of religious adjustment among the various peoples and cults which have gone to make up the toity that is Hinduism
Two main tendences are noticeable in what may be presumed ta be the last staves in the evolution of Rgvedic religion A feeling seems to hase been gradually taking root in the minds of the Rgvedic poet-priests that the mythological gods were quite

ipadequate to satisfy their religious instinct They were, as it were, groping for a real god, and, therefore, asked in great anguish kasmai de âya hausā vidhena (RV X 121 ) The other tendency, as shown earlier, was to reduce the perplexing multipli city in the divine world to some kind of unity
There is very little of mythology in the Athanaveda, for, mythopoetic activity and magic do not normally go well together The gods as represented in that Veda are but subservient to magic which is the central theme of that Veda And the basic founda tion of the Atharvanıc magic is none other than the &ldquo;pan-asuism* of the Rgveda This latter is also at the root of the Vedic ritual such as has been developed in the Brāhmanas The Brāhnianas seem to give some prominence to the new god Prajāpatı, which fact has persuaded some scholars to discover a kind of mono theism in it But Prajāpat is by no means a mythological or a theological deity He does not possess any individuality, he mostly appears as the central figure in the ritual of creative self immolation The Vedic fitual is conceived as an autonomous phenomenon and as operating automatically, that is, indepen dently of god or man in the ideology of the Vedic ritual, gods do not play any important role The Brāhmana texts, which set great store by the correct performance of an inordinately complex system of sacrifices, may be said to have actually ousted god from the centre of the religious stage (if he had at all occupied that centre any time!) Indeed, it was sacrifice which was believed to have bestowed godhead on gods Sacrifice was intended to coerce gods rather than to propitiate them
If the Brahmadic ritualism had divested the mythological gods of their individualities and functions, the Upanisadic spin tualism completely negatived their importance and influence in connection with the world process The early Upanisdds taught the doctrine of the ultimate identity between the brahmant, the universe, and the individual self This utter monism allowed no scope whatsoever for theism It was, however, obviously not possible that such a rigorous metaphysical position could be maintaincd for long Popular religious sentiment is not satisticd

with an abstract impersonal entity, it craves for a personal deity Besides, there must have been pressures - both of a pozjuse and of a negative character - from the con-Vedic religious ideologes Consequently tere began to appear, in the pariscds, more or less clear-cut theistic tendencies a hich are seen to have reached their culmination in the Steräsralara-parisad Already in the Chandogsa-Cparised (ILI 14), Sodilya speaks of the man in terras which are rercmucent of a personal god The chiarjantre doctrine of the Brhadârcrjako-parisid (II 7 8 ) and that Upanisad&rsquo;s characterisuon of the mal an airā as sarrasja rasi, santara Israk sarrasju adrpalthsarrestaracturadripauh, brütcpālah, etc (IV +22) may also be regarde the therstic direction The Brhadaranızda-l parisad (147) seems to think of the supreme being as something etternal to the world
But a d stinct mtimation of the traosition from mooism to theism becomes available from the Vurdala-Upasad acd more particularly from the Sretāstataro-parisd The Stetāstatara Upamisad (I 12 ) caequr ocally dotinguiskes dhoker (tke individual self), thogja (the phenomecal xorld), and prenir (the god) from one another, and then speaks of these three forming trin dram brafma The supreme being is referred to (IV 11-13) by terms denoting a personal god, such as isāna, rorada, idya dera, ustadhipa, de ärāns ad ipa, etc He is the source and ongia of the gods, the ruler of all, Rudra. The lord 15 the supporter of all this which is a combination of putable and romutable He 15 aot idenucal with the indusideal self, but pervades it without Sharing 10 its imperfections and actions. There is also a sugges top in that Upar sad of a bhakti-uke personal relatopship between the supreme being and the individual self The god in his immacent spect is to be knaan through yoga, the god in his transcendent aspect is to be worshipped with loving devotion Further, the Sretānarara-Uparjad emphasizes the necessity of moral conduct and the possibility of the grace of god The Sretāsratara-Upansod may thus be regarded as presenting perbaps the earlkst full-fledged theistic statement in histoncal Hindum
120

And the fact that the great god according to that statement is Rudra is historically very significant, for, it may have been a direct result of the influence of the proto historical Hindu mono theism centering round proto-Sıya
The history of classical Hinduisma presents a strange pheno menon While, on the one hand, Hinduism sought to substitute the impersonal absolute of the Upanısads with a personal god, the various philosophical systems, which it adopted as its own, were, by and large, basically atheistic The Samkhya system, for instance, whose beginnings, incidentally, must be traced back to the pre-Vedic non Aryan thought complex, had originally no place for god in its metaphysics The process of the evolution of the material and the psychological world from the Prakšti was believed to be autonomous It was only at a later stage in the development of the Sāmkhya doctrine that god came to be posited as being jostrumental in bringing Praktı and Purusa into contact with each other and thereby initiating the world process The Hinduism of the epics and the Puranas has mostly sponsored this latter kind of Sāmkhya, namely, the seśvara Sāmkhya The Yoga system, which concerns itself essentially with mental and spiritual discipline but which has generally adopted the Samkhya doctrine as its metaphysical basis, does accept god God, accord ing to that system, is after all a Purusa or soul, but he is a distinctive kind of soul He is different from other souls not so much because he is eternal and transcends the limitations of time, but because, unlike other Purusas, he ever remains unaffected by the ramifications of Prakrti He is also said to be responsible for the maintenance of the cosmic order, but he is never specifi cally represented as the cause of the universe He is thus redeemed of any bability for the inequality and cruelty jo the world Not only this, he is even said to be positively compas. Siodate There is further an indication in the Yoga system of a kind of an ontological argument such as that, since we have an idea of a Prefect Supreme Being, such a Being must be in exis. tencc But the most outstanding feature of god&rsquo;s personality which the Yoga system seems to emphasize is that he is the ideal

121
object of contemplation Yogic conceptration, it 15 soggested, is facilitated through devotion to god The Yoga system may, accordingly, be said to reflect tbe beginning of the theastic ideal of religio-ethical godhead.
The Vabeskas, Uke the Samkhyes, generally seco to hold that the world-process is 10 DO vay dependent on god, though, it may be added, the Varsesika-Sūtras proper do not contain any direct passage bearing on tbe creation and ibe dissolupon of the userse The Varesika system maintains that reason canpot prove the existence of god However, the atutude of that system towards god cannot be said to be as uncompromising as that of the original Samkhya The later Vanesika theory such as is, for lostaoce, developed in the blásja of Pravastapāda, presumably under the groping theistic jafi uerce speaks of god as being actively instrumental 19 the er olution and dissolution of the uonerse The Njáya system represents pot so much a philoso phucal system as a logical methodology Its metaphysical basis Is derned largely from the Valsesila atomism It mentions god malals as the sentient administrator of the law of Karma It is god who ensures that that lan does not operate promiscuously Some Marjakas, like Vācaspati and Udasdda offer logical proof for the existence of a primal cause posessing intelligence of the highest order God 15 believed to joitiate the creative process He is the operause cause of the underse, but he does not get humself involved in the workings of the upiverse It honever, needs to be underlined that the god of the Naya system is hardly comparable to the personal god of the proper theistic ideology
The Pūrsanimāmsā treats god with scant respect. For, according to it, the Vedic ntual, ubicb is its chief concern, operates automatically and autonomously God is subservient to the ntpal performance and is often regarded as even superious. Indeed for the Pün amimams, which essentially deals with the technique of interpreting the Vedic texts, the subject of god is almost irrelevant it, therefore, often ignores god It bas been well said that, according to Miminsä, gods can be regarded only as hypothetical entities which one has to assume because they art

essential for the ritual act In the eyes of the Mimāmsakas, * Veda&rsquo; is far more vital and important than Deva' Inciden tally, the Vedic ritual does not also seem to bother about the &ldquo;moralness&rdquo; of the character of the sacrificer and the officiating Prests or of the purpose of the sacrificial act
A characteristic feature of the Vedānta as represented by Samkara is the assumption of two main levels of reality - trans cendental or absolute and phenomenal or empirical The ultimate and the only reality is, no doubt, the brahman in its transcenden tal aspect Naturally enough, this immutable bralınan caonot be made liable for any kind of activity like that of creating the universe The universe may have only relative reality, but its creation had nonetheless to be explained It is in this context that god is posited by Samkara In other words, god is real on the same level as the individual self and the universe The con ception of god is, after all, a hypothesis which right knowledge eventually dicards But, as long as that right philosophical knowledge does not dawn upon a person, he has to accept god seriously and with adequate zeal Thus Samkara does not deny the existence of god on the empirical level However, on this level, the individual self is not to be identified with god For, the ways in which the māyā operates with reference to god on the one hand and to the jodividual self on the other are essenlially different Of course, when the mājà ceases to operate, there is neither god nor individual self
A brief mention may now be made of the attitude of some of the avowedly theistic schools The Bhagavadgitā seems to oscillate between pantheistic monism on the one hand and fervent theism centred round a personal god on the other It sometimes represents god as an aspect of the brahman-as a personalized version of the bralıman-st being thus suggested that the brahman is the supreme being, but it ultimately proclaims as its gulya. Tama - most esoteric-teaching that, beyond the undifferentiated unity of the brahinian, there is the god, who is the Supreme Person characterised by numberless perfections, who is the ethical lord, who is actively involved in the world process but who nevertheless

remains eternally changeless in his essence, and who, above all, bears ceep affection and love for his devotees. The teaching of the Bhagajadzitā regarding the nature of god continues to dommate the later religio-philosophical tests of the Bhagavatas, such as the warājarija and the Amugită in the ckabr234, the VISP-Purina, the Pacarıra-Somas and the Bhagavatt Purāna The only noteworthy modification in the basic teaching of the Bagavadgita is the doctrire of ones, which is adumbra ted in the Marijaniza and fully developed in the Purcarētra. Samnitás According to this doctrice, the true nature of Vasu deva the supreme god, I consututed of the scegunja or sex qualities, namely, fura or absolute consciousness with its five characteristics, sakit (which enables Vasadeva to become the material cause of the universe ), atsvarja (or independent spontaneous power of action ) bala (or inexhaustible power of sustaining the world), virja (or the ability to remain unchanged despite being the material dose), and teus (or prestige ard authority with which be bras forta the universe without any extraceous help). These sit guras are represented on the one hand, as forming Văsudeva s body, and, on the other, ay serving, through the three juhes -Sankarsada, Pradyum2, und Adr. ruddha, 18 each of these ty has only two out of the six gunas being specially attested -as the instruments of his creative activity
Madhva may be said to be teacting a sort of an almost uodiluted monotheism He unequivocally recognizes the dualism between god and the creat on, both of whuch are real, though he does not fail to add that god alone is absolute and independent Madhva emphasizes the fivefold difference, namely, between god and soul, bera een god ard patter, between soul add matter, between one soul and another acd between Oce atom of matter and another Icdeed, he is so uncompromising in this respect that he is not unoften seen to be twisting the patentlv pantasistic texts to yield monotheist c-dualistic sease As for the tresm of Vallabha and Caitanya it may be pointed out that emotional, passionate - almost erotic - love for a personal god is its most outstanding feature

But by far the ablest statement of what may be called philosophical theism we owe to Rāmānuja Ramanuja&rsquo;s persona lity often betrays an inner conflict between a philosopher and a theologian&ndash; the latter usually having the upper hand Rāmānuja was not only a metaphysician, he was also and perhaps more essentially - a founder of a religious sect According to him, the existence of god cannot be established by means of logic For instance, one cannot argue, as on the empirical plane, that just as a living body presupposes the existence of the soul or intelligent agent, even so does the world process presuppose the existence of an intelligent motive principle like god for, the analogy here is not perfect, the soul not being ever assumed as the creator of the body Nor can the analogy of potter clay-picher be regarded as compelling enough to establish in connection with the universe the existence of god as the agent possessing the knowledge of the material cause For, as Rāmānuja seems to suggest, even a lesser being than god as he has conceived him would be quite adequate for the purpose On the other hand, though the scriptures constitute for Ramānuja the only authoritative source for the knowledge of god, his peculiar attitude towards the Upanisad&rsquo;s tends to show that he has realised that the Upanisads do not support the doctrine sponsored by him
God, according to Rūmīnusa, has for his attributes the six gumas, namely, jñāna, etc, mentioned by the Pāőcarātra texts He is characterised by all perfections He is the supreme dividity which creates this world of manifold experience which is essen trally real The world, consisting of souls and matter, is depen. dent on god, it is, indeed, god&rsquo;s body Rāmānuja further points out that the world is related to god as modes or attributes are related to substance This would bring out the appropriateness of his teaching being designated as wis1514 ad, aila Incidentally it may be noted that, according to Rāmānuja, god exists jo five different modes -as Para or the entire supreme spitit, as the four wühas, as an avatāra like Rima or Krsna, as the antaryamin, and as a duly consecrated image
Various Views have been put forth regarding the nature ol

125
god and the ultimate reality in modern Hipdu thought The Arya Samaj, for costance, seems to sponsor a Liod of monothersunt as against Vedāntic mopism It believes in three fundamental realities, namely, god, soul, and the uptverse On the other hand, Sri AUROBINDO speaks of integral advaltısm-of one Brahman with positive and negative aspects Bat the general trend in Neo-Hindoism may be said to be towards some kind of reconciliation between the absolute and the god Swam, VIVEKA. NAYDA regards god as the dynamic aspect of the highest reality TAGORE thinks of the reality as teing both impersonal and personal, as chaogeless and evolving, as being and becoming And according to RADHAKRISHNAN, the god is the absolute from the cosmic point of view and the absolute represents the precosmic nature of god
It may be specially pointed out here that, in whatever forms theism developed in classical Hinduism and Neo-Hicdum, it alsays had a pantherstic tinge Hindu temperament and Hindu Jogic must be said to be particularly corducise to a pantbestic religion Indeed, lodia, as a whole, has come to be recognised as the classic land of panikeism, aod the vanons Indian religions are regarded as representing but different stages of panibersm. There is, however, often percepuble a tendency to suggest that even pootheismo is rot the ultimate truth Actually Hindu thought IS pot inclined to make any sharp distinction between philosophical monio aod religious panthers. It is, therefore, not infrequently that this modism-paotheism tends to be represented (or, rather, misrepresented) either as acosmism or as polite atheism
The two main questions relatiog to god and the world-process are (1) How did god create the world? acd (11) why did god create tbe world? Vanous viens have been expressed io connec tion with the first question To begin with, there are some schools of Hindu thought which do not at all regard the sorld as the bandinork of god Indeed Hinduism is said to represent a peculiar religious phenomenon in which god does not deces santy figure as the creator nor does bis will constitute the moral law One extreme vient is that the phenomenal world is basically an

allusion, a false presentment of god or the ultimate reality, an imagined transformation of the supreme being The usual analogy in this respect is that of the rope which, under certain circumstances, appears as serpent It is pointed out that so long as the world appears it is in the Brahman which is the only reality This does not, however, affect the transcendent character of the ultimate reality, Brahman, in the same way as the essential &quot; ropeness&rdquo; of the rope is in no way affected by its transient appearance as serpent From the ultimate point of view, there does not exist any god as such apart from the impersonal, abso lute Brahman However, in view of the essential immutability of Brahman, the existence of god may be temporarily posted as a kind of connecting link between the immutable Brahman and the temporary illusion of the world for, as long as the illusion of the world is not recognized as an illusion, it does possess what may be called relative reality So, god, according to this view, stands on the same level of reality as the world and the individual self
The Bràlunanas and the early Upanisads often mention a cosmological theory according to which creation amounts to some kind of emanation or rather discharge (srst) which is not dependent either on the will or the activity of a divine person In otber words, creation is there represented as 1 purely materia listic process Another cosmological theory, which is atheistic and materialistic presupposes the time less co-existence of two essen tially contradictory and mutually independent entities, namely, prakrlı or thc undifferentiated matter, which however, possesses the potentiality of evolving, and purusa or the multiplicity of souls which is capable of seeing but incapable of acting These two come into a relationship with each other - one cannot say how - and the process of the evolution of the cosmological and psychological world is thereby started The Valsesika cosmology, which involves a specific kind of conglomeration of eternally existing atoms is like the original Samkhya prakrti-purusa cosmo logy, also atheistic
Side by side with such atheistic materialistic theories of creation, there have developed in Indian thought, even from very
GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT
127
early times, different kinds of personalistic-theistic theories of creation The descriptions of Vedic gods as having been respod. sible for the creation aod sustenance of the universe have to be understood rather as poetical erercises intended to emphasize the power and greatpess of those gods than as any deliberate cosmo logical speculations But a reference must be made in this conrection to the viet suggested in the Purusasühta (RV X 90) that the upverse is the result of the ritual self-immolation of a hermaphrodie man-cod Some Upadisadıc accounts bowever. represent cosmology with a more specific personalistic bias For lastance, the Prawa Upanisad (I 3-13) tells us that, at the begipoog of creation, Prajāfat the creator, having become desirous of progeny, practised penance, and, after having practi sed peoapce, produced the original couple, rajı and prána, who eventually created all that exists Elsewhere ( Tarttırja-Up II 6), Prajāpati, who, presumably, bad become tired of his solitude, is said to have emitted, by way of a relief from that solitude, the entire creation The ideas underlying these two theories seem to hare merged together to give rise to a third theory Atmin, who alone existed in the beginniog of things in the form of man, with a view to getting rid of his topeliness, divided himself into tro balses - one male and the other female - and then procreated the various species in the organic world (Brhadāraniala-Up I 4)&ndash;) These ard simular other theories are no doubt more of less personalistic (10 contrast to the purely impersonalistic-mate nalistic theones referred to above), but they can by no means be characterized as theistic in the strictest sense of the term
A mention has already been made of the soclusion of god 10 Some cosmologial theories as a demiurge or a secondary creator It may be added that the demiurge is sometimes represented also as the poner (mājā sahn) or the manifestation (199ha) of the ulinate reality which alope must be regarded as the absolute substratum and source of the unnerse in this context must be mentioted also the imagery of the golden embno in which the first personal creatise being is represented as having himself proceeded from a material substratum in the mythical form,

this being is called Hiranyagarbha or Nārāyana 15 Such cosmo logical theories, however, are basically pantheistic and seem to have later developed in the direction of a pale and shallow theism which Hinduism is said to have often “confessed with lips but which has never won the homage of its heart &ldquo;16 in a more distinctly theistic theory, the creation is represented as a process of manifestation or evolution starting from god The world process is, indeed, regarded as a rhythmic movement consisting of alternate emissions and reabsorptions of the world by the supreme being It is this form of cosmology which usually figures in the Purānic Hinduism Another cosmological theory which is popular vith the Puranas 15 a modification of the original Sānkhya doctrine At 1 later stage in the development of the Samkhya doctrine god came to be superimposed on the prakrilo purusa dualism as having been responsible for bringing prakrti and purusa into contact with each other and thereby initiating the world process Prakrti and purusa came to be regarded as just the two aspects of the supreme lord who, through his guiding and controlling will, gave the first impulse to prahrt to shake off its equilibrium It may be added that, like this theistic Sámkhya doctrine, we also have a theistic Vansesika doctrine which postu lates a god who is responsible for switching on the process of the conglomeration of the eternally existing atoms Thus, by and large, the role of god 10 Hindu cosmological speculations may be said to have been thought of only secondarily, and its scope to have been regarded as very much limited
Assuming that god created the world, one might feel natu rally inclined to ask oneself as to what could have been god s motive for doing so This motive cannot have been &lsquo;love&rsquo;, for, love normally implies the craving for sympathy and fellowship from an entity other than cneself and god is believed to transcend ?l kinds of saying Nor can it have been the impulse to &lsquo;work, for, work normally aims at getting onc s needs satisfied or one&rsquo;s

insufficiencies recouped and god is regarded as being free from all Deeds and insufficiencies Similarly, the world annot have been created by god for bis ora benefit, because god is perfect, it cannot have also been created for the benefit of man, because it is characterized by innate requality and cruelty Agjid, in Creating the umperse, god cannot be said to have felt urged to execute any specific plan Indeed, in connection with god&rsquo;s relation to the world, Hırdu thinkers base hardly ever thought in terms of the design, plan, or obect of the world It is sometimes suggested that god created the world because he was moved by some reproductive itapule, by an instinctae urge to multiply hund self, or that it was just a passing sum of god But this would seem to go agaiast the rationality of god Another assumption is that god himself, as much as idan, is subject to some universal 128 which constrains him to create the world Obviously, such an assumption would cegate the oppo&rsquo;ence of god. According to still another sex, god has created the world with a view to affordiog man the opportunity to redeem himself of his liabilities under the moral lan of Karma (though, it must be added, the law of Kartua is believed to be operating independentiy of god and god in no way predestines the conditions of man&rsquo;s life) This would, on the one hand, account for the requality and cruelty Lo the world withoat miling the creator responsible for them, and world, on the other, emphasize god&rsquo;, solicitude for man whose Journey of the road to mroksa he thus hastens Io a sense, god is keen on facilitating the divinization of man. For, god Is said to desire union with the soul as fen ently as the soul desires union with god Hindaism, it may be pointed out, does not stop with affording only a one-way road, namely, from the soul to god, it provides for a tto-say communicauon between the two
But the thecry which seems to have been found generally acceptable by various schools of Hindu thought is that the world process is but the sport-lila-of god This Iā which provides an outlet for the eruberant spint of god, is to be thought of just as play for the sake of play Essectially it amoants to the release of

energy for the sake of the release of energy 17 The assumption of līlā alone can explain why one who is perfect and self-sufficient does do anything Actually to impute any motive to god&rsquo;s act: vity would mean denying his very god-head Lilā constitutes a motive which is, indeed, no motive at all The assumption of lila is significant from yet another point of view Metaphorically, the word lilā would very well bring out the sense of the miracle of the one appearing as many. It would further suggest the temporal character of the world whose reality is not to be taken with absolute seriousness Again, the concept of lilā, jo its sexual connotation, may be related to the concept of god and his consort Saktı being responsible for the creation of the universe It is also not unlikely that the later Hindu love-mysticism has something to do with this imagery of god&rsquo;s la Of course, it must be conceded that the concept of lilā does not explain away all the difficulties in connection with the question of god&rsquo;s motive for the creation of the world For instance, it fails to rationalize the inequality and cruelty in the world It would seen as if god&rsquo;s sportive instinct was governed by the universal moral law of Karma At any rate, the concept of Gilā cannot be said to constitute any serious philosophical doctrine, it only serves as a fairly satisfactory analogy
Uolke many other religions, Hinduism is hardly ever repre sented as a system of ethics Indeed, ethics occupies but a midor place in Hindu religious ideology By and large, Hindu thought does not make any sharp distinction between spirit and matter, it thereby discards the very basis of morality The pantheistic overtone of Hinduism must also be said to have been responsible for its amoralism In this connection it is pertinently asked how a tide can sin against the sea In Hindu thought, god is rarely conceived as a moral lord and governor Hindu morality, accor dingly, does not mean obedience to the will of god Profound speculativeness is a distinctive mark of Hindu temperament, and this is reflected in the fact that Hindu religio philosophical ideo

logy has raised knowledge to a higher pedestal than either morality or devotional worship of god Virtue I», do doubt desirable, but without true knowledge it is rendered futile For a Hirdu thinker the real sin is ignorance it is man&rsquo;s onder standing which is involved in it and not hrs will As has been very tellingly put, the badness of bad conduct lies in that it darkens the vision of truth Socrates says that an enlightened person would generally do no wrong The Hindu thinker seems to assert that a truly enlightened person is always right Accord jag to the Hiodu thought, salvation does pot mean deliverance from so against god, it rather means freedom from avdia The consciousness of moral guilt becomes magifest relatively seldom, and the prayer is usually intended for vision rather than for Pardan
The attitude of Hinduism in respect of morality is essentially polar. Oo the one hand, morality as such is believed to be in no way related either to religion or to god As apparently immoral act, for instance, is not regarded as being necessarily irreligious Ever the Thogs could claim that their nefarious activities were a part of their religion A saint may be morally extravagant but he is nevertheless religiously much esteemed For, it is through his rigorous asceticism, which may not be necessarily compatible with the conveational code of moral conduct, that the saint is believed to attain a direct insight into the divine mystery Similarly as has been already pointed out, morality, according to Hizdo thought, does not amouot to the conforming of one&rsquo;s conduct to the will of god Nor does it imply obedience to a categorical itoperative At best, morality may be looked upon as an instru ment of social adjustment At the same time, Hinduism is seen to have gone to the other extreme in that it has elevated the doctrine of Karma, which is intensely ethical to the position of an trrevocable cosmic law
Though most of the Hindu gods have been invested with particular attributes and vehicles, their basic nature continues to be vague and impersonal The individual gods capnot, accordingly, be sharply distinguished from one another Nor can the mututal132

relationship among the various gods be said to be clearly defined It may be further pointed out that the nature of individual gods 15 often submerged and lost in the exuberant mythology which has grown round them Unlike the gods of some other religions, the character of a Hindu god as the creator of man and the universe is but little emphasized So far as Hinduism 15 concerned, it may be more apt to say that, instead of god having created man, man has created gods - and that too after his own image Therefore, while, in one sepse, the Hindu gods are vague and impersonal, 18 another sense, they tend to become almost identical with men Many of man&rsquo;s special characteristics are seen also in gods For one thing, gods, like men, are by no means wholly free and independent They are not unoften represented as being subject to the law of Karma Gods, like men, bave their own peculiar religion to which they have to be loyal Indeed, a Hindu god&rsquo;s nature is a curious mixture of the human, the mythological, and the philosophical
In the course of the development of various views regarding the gods of Hinduism, some landmarks are clearly noticeable As has been already pointed out, in the early Vedic period, people celebrated many gods or devas - most of them embodying the &ldquo;asuistic&rdquo; ideology - but no one god in the monotheistic sense In the Upani sads, the supreme being, which was emphatically Asserted to be one and without a second, was more or less comple tely impersonalised The classical Hinduism, which must be said to have largely inherited the religious ideology and practice of the proto historical Hinduism, manifested itself, in its initial stages, la the form of the two major sects, namely, Vaisnavism and Saivism. These sects were almost monotheistic in character - they repre sented a kind of modified monotheism Visnu and Siva were regarded as having, as it were, transcended the hierarchy of mythological gods who were quite numerous, and were headed by Indra, the king of gods and his regents, the dihpālas Besides Vaisnavısm and Saivism there also emerged sects centering round other divinities like Sakti, Surya, and Ganesa - each of them again representing a kind of modified monotheism It must,
GOD N HINDU THOUGHT
133
however, be stressed that these sects, howsomenuch they differed from one another 10 respect of their strength and the atent of their influecce, hardly ever sought to extinguish one anolher On the contrary, 10 course of time and in conformity with the usual trend of development in Hinduism, the fire cults, respectively centering round Surya, Garea, Vistu, Sna, and Saktı, instead of each of them having been regarded as absolute and updependent, came to be regarded as constituting the five steps in a sugle religious echelon
lo connection with the Bhakti-cuit to the Drandian region, four gods are specially mentioned, namely, &quot; the red one with blue throat&rdquo; (that ts, Sira ), &quot; the white one of the ploughshare and the palmayra flag&rdquo; (that is, Baladera ),&rdquo; the blue one with the eagle fag&rdquo; (that is, Krsna ), and &ldquo;the nder on the elephant with the peacock flag&rdquo; (that is, Subrahmyz) A reference may also be made here to gods like Brahmă, Väyu, Agni, Yarom, etc, who had no clearcut sect2r120 afiliations Incidentally, some Buddhist sources speak of three classes of divinides, namely. (1) Yines and holy mea or proptets, (1) defied heroes like Vasudeva and Baladeva, and (w) popular folk-dinjites like 5op, moon, fire, etc
A briel Dote on the female diyabes in Hinduism would be quite apropos at this stage So far as the proto-historical Hinduism is concerned, it is overwhelmingly domigated by the three-headed horned male god-proto-Siva But, as pointed out cisen here, the worship of &quot; mothers &quot; also sens to have consti tuted a significant feature of that religion As against this, in the hieratic Vedic religion, got much importance is attached to female divities Aditi u the Rgreda, for instadce, is hardly ever invested with the personality and character of the Mother-Goddess as such, while the character of Usas-as also of Prthivi - has been concened by the Vedic poets as being little more than transparently datoralistic Some of the other female divities in the Veda are exther mere colourless female counterparts or wnes of male gods, or otherwise they represent the later deificabon of some abstract concepts It would, indeed, seem that the distinc

tive religious ideology centering round the female divinities was essentially indigenous and that it forced itself into the Vedic ideology - though not to any large extent -as the inevitable result of the contact of the Vedic Aryans with the indigenous population of India Two aspects of this ideology deserve to be specially noticed here for one thing, these female divinities are mainly worshipped by the common folk A mention may be made in this context of the gramadeatās – the mothers - like Mariamman and Kottavai of the Tamil country as also of the divinities like Sitala and Manasā They are regarded specifically as“ pegative&quot; divinities in the sense that they are prayed to not so much tbat they may bestow any positive good on the wor shipper as that they may forestall the evils which are likely to befall him Nirīti, Sinivāli, Kubū, and Gungū are presumably the Vedic reflections of some of such indigenous female dividities It would also be seen that, in the Atharvaseda, spirits with feminine names were usually associated with diseases and disasters Such &quot; negative&quot; female dividities are, indeed, quite numerous in popular Hinduism
The second aspect of the religious ideology relating to the female dividities is far more significant from the theological point of view In this context, one may speak of one goddess rather than of many female divinities This goddess usually represents the personification of the &ldquo;power&rdquo; of the great god and is often regarded as his consort The great god is, indeed, the self sufficient, static aspect of the ultimate, but he is believed to have a consort, wbo is both one with and subordinate to him and who alone serves as the motive force behind the world-process It is only through her that the supreme being becomes involved in the cosmic activity Such goddess, for instance, is Sakti On the one hand, she personifies the creative as well as the destructive power of the great god Śiva, while, on the other, she is the great goddess - the mother goddess – in her own right and has an inde pendent religious cult developed round her in the Piñcarátra texis and the Puranas, Laksmi is sometimes represented as the sakni - both from the formal and the material points of view of

Nārāyana. It is through her that Närāyan3 passes from his transcendental and undifferentiated form to a form characterised by the six qualities of aistarja The proto-lustoncal counterpart of Sakti s pot as distinctly represented as that of Siva, but the extent of her influence, even in the pre-Vedic times, may sery well be imagined from such of her reflections in the Vedic literature as Vāk (RV X. 125) and Umā (Kena-Upanisad 3 12) Inciden tally, it may be added that the two aspects of the religious Ideology concerning the female diyipities, which have been referred to above, are sometimes seen to mogle with each other 10 a loose manner
In Hindu religious thought, the concept of Satan or Devil or Prince of Darkness as such hardly ever occurs with any promi nence. A figure like that of the Buddhist Māra is absent in Hindu mythology Tbe sharp duality of superhuman poners with opposite moral qualties - the duality, that is to say, of poners of light and powers of darkness-as, for rastance, ia the Zoroastrian dithetsm, has never been the basis of Hindu religious ideology. The character of Vrtra or Abu of the Rgreda whom Indra vanquishes is essentially different from that of the Devil He cap by no means be said to represent evil personified 10 a single figure The same thing may be said of Ravana, the adver sary of Rāma in the Rāmājana Indeed, Råvana is often represented as a pious and learned Brāhmand Many demonjac antagonists of divine powers have, no doubt been mentioned in the Puranas But they are often shown to possess several good features of character, and they are either quickly overpowered by the gods or actually become the worshippers of gods Many of them have ongupally been great and noble persons, who, for some minor lapses, are cursed to be temporarily transformed into demons The existence of evil is generally said to be the reason for the existence of religioo But this dictum does not seem to hold good in respect of Hinduism
The doctrine of ararõra or descent of god on the earth marks a new and fairly well-defined pbase in the development of Hudursa It may, however, be pointed out at the very outset
136
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
that the avatāra-theory has to be essentially differentiated from the primitive motif of a god descending to the earth According to the Hindu conception, god actually appears on this earth in various forms at various times to fulfil certain specific purposes Of course, in his įpcarpations, god does not appear 10 his highest form, which is, indeed, incomprehensible to the mortal eye He assumes a mortal form (either human or animal), but, even in that form, his transcendental power becomes unmistakably mani fest The avatára is not to be understood merely as a transitory manifestation of the deity, it represents a mystic but real presence of the supreme being in a mortal body The anthropomorphism (or, in a few cases, the zoomorphism) is complete in every respect, but there becomes clearly evident a union of infinite divinity on the one hand and finite individuality on the other
The avatāras must be said to be a special characteristic of Vaisnavısm However, the classical theory in this respect does not seem to have been formulated in the epic period The Mahābhārata, for instance, does not contain any systematic account of the avatāras It is in the Purānas that the scheme of the ten avatāras is fully developed Indeed, the treatment of this subject in some Purānic passages is quite diversified since they give lists of avatāras other than the classical ten The ten incarna tions, in which Visnu is, according to the normal classical tradition, believed to have appeared on this earth, are Fish (Matsya ), Tortoise (Kūrma), Boar (Varaha), Man Lion (Narasimha ), Vāmana, Parasurāma, Rāma, Krsna, the Buddha, and Kalks Räma is sometimes regarded as only a partial avatāra - one balt of the divinity having been divided among his brothers Two other points 10 connection with Rāma are noteworthy Firstly, there is no Purāna exclusively dedicated to Ráma (presumably because Rāma-worship did not offer much scope for Purānic sectarianism ), and, secondly, the divine personality of Rāma had been so conceived that it could be conveniently combined with any other god even with Siva ( as has been testified by the figure of Rameswara) As against Rāma, Krsna is celebrated as a full incarnation or pūrpavatāra As a matter of fact, in some
GOD IN HINDU THOUGHT
137
accounts, Balarama (Krsna&rsquo;s elder brother) is substituted for Krsna as aralēra, for the latter is believed to be god himself and pot bus aratāra In some other aratāra-lists, Krşqa is mentioned after Balarama or in the place of Balarama or in the place of the Buddha
In the Buddba-incarnation, Visou is supposed to bave been born as the &ldquo;Deluder in order to mislead the demons with false doctrine and thereby bring about their uodoing That aratūra may also be regarded as being intended for recognizing the personal greatness of the Buddha while, at the same time, depre cating his teachings The tenth and the last aratara, namely, Kalkt, is to appear at the end of the present Kalı epoch Ridung a horse called Devadatta, Kalkı aill overrun the earth, par an end to all evil, poxers, and re-establish moral order
The germs of some of the avatāras of Visou, such as Matsya, Kurma, Varáha, and Vāmata, may be discovered in the Vedic Legends la some cases, the forms wluch the Prajāpati of Vedisa is seen to base assumed on dutierent occasions have been trans ferred to the Visnu of Hinduisto It is, however, not improbable that Vedism itself had borroned those ideas from the proto-lodian religious thought-complex. We also find that several peculiar features of Vedic Visuu&rsquo;s personality and character are reflected in his classical Hindu aratãras locidentally, it may be posated oot that the Arestan Verethragoa is also said to have appeared in teo incarnations and that some scholars like CHARPENTIER and BENVEXISTE are inclined to connect these incarnations with the araröras of Visnu Further, it is not unlikely that the Hiddo aratăra-theory, the Jaisa tradition of the Tirthamkaras, and the Buddhist conception of the Boddha&rsquo;s mapy births have some genetical relationship
The Hindu theory of aratāras is significant from various points of view To begro with, it is always asserted that the road purpose for which Visau appeared in his vanous incarnations was to establish moral order in a world which had become spintually dissolute As the Bhagavadgită (IV 7) says Whenever nghi. eousness languishes and varighteousness thrives, theo does god

incarnate himself This moral aspect of the avatāra-theory is emphasized in another way as well, pamely, by suggesting that god, appearing in his avatāra, placed before man a norm which might help the latter in properly Orienting his spiritual life God is believed to have come to man in order that man might become god by following his example The descent of the Divine is regarded as having been intended for promoting the ascent of the individual In this context, Rāma was often represented as the absolute ideal for all humanity, for, the Rāmāyana seems to have portrayed Rima as a man who became god rather than as god who bad incarnated himself as man
The avatāra-theory also facilitated the transcendent being brought into direct relation with the phenomenal world It is suggested that, from his eternal existence as an incomprehensible undivided unity, god descended into the existence characterised by time and history apd thereby invested with some meaning the otherwise meaningless cycles of time The avatāra-theory was a grand attempt by the religionist to personalize the impersonal reality of the philosopher, not only conceptually but also empiri cally It afforded the unique experience of the One co-existing with the Many, and thereby helped the consolidation of the doctrine of blakti For, the motive for the avatāras, which was stressed as strongly and as often as the establishment of Dharma, was god&rsquo;s desire to show grace and do good to those who were devoted to him and whom he loved Psychologically, a single god manifesting himself in various forms must have adequately met the fancies of different kinds of people The aratára theory also served, from time to time, as an assurance, which was perhaps psychologically much needed, that god did not remain merely an indifferent and uninterested spectator of the world-process but that he duly recognized his role of responsible involvement in it
From the point of view of the history of Hinduism the avatara theory may be regarded as a major factor in the religious Synthesis brought about by that religion Originally, the different dividities like Rāma, Kțsnı, Parašurāma etc, scem to have beca The gods of different religious cults When, in the course of the

139
religious history of India, these cults federated themselves to form #hat came to be known as Hinduism some kind of unity of god head was sought to be actueved by those gody being represented as the incarnations of one single god Visou On the other tand, this also helped to elevate the status of the objects of worship of certain primitive cults It may be further poted that the aratase theory generally tended to supersede the philosophical partheism and to promote some kind of tbeology approaching monotheism or at least polytbeism organized under a single gode Incidentally, a reference may also be made here to che suggestion that the sequence of the ten avatāras reflects the various stages 10 the esolution of man himself
Among other concepts, bich are in some way related to the coccept of araråra but which must ceeds be essentially differentiat ed from it, may be oeationed those of prădurbhana wherein god manifests bunself while remaining transcendent in his true form; tants or appearances in certain specific aspects which laiter may be co-existeot (this concept having been developed more parti cularly in Santism), āresa or enteriag ito and getting possession of some pratika, ribhūtus or special manifestations in eminent entities jūtas or cosmological ard psychological emanations of the supreme being, ribhava or jacarpate form whalb god, in his grace, assumes, from time to time, in order to be accessible to his devotees, antarjām nor god as the inner self of man, and arcâ or the idol-form of god
One of the striking features of popular Hinduism, as against Vedism which may, in a sease, be said to have culminated in the Upanısadıc spiritualism, is that it seeks to substitute a religion as contemplation by a religion as practice it is in this context that a study of the Hirdu concept of worship becomes relevant The Yedic Aryan religious practice was manly of the nature of home, ihat is, of the offering of oblations to gods, who were pot directly prese3t before the sacrificer 10 the form of idols or images, on the sacred fires in the accompadiment of Vedic mantras With the advent of historical Hinduism, Vedic roma or ritual came to be more or less superseded by a form of worship popularly known as
140
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
pūjä The centre of the entire procedure of pūjā was the idol or the image or some other concrete symbol of the divinity, which was ceremonially bathed and anointed with sandalwood-paste or coloured powder and to which offerings of flowers, food, milk, sweets, etc, were made in the accompaniment of the racital of mantras and prayers, the ringing of bells, and the burning of lights and incense Actually the pre-Vedic non-Aryan religion &ndash; that is to say, proto historical Hinduism - also seems to have been characterised by some kind of religious practice akın to pājā Naturally enough, dunng the Vedic interlude, homa or Vedic ritual came to be generally recognized as the representative religious practice But in classical Hinduism pūjă was again revived in a highly developed and complex form A third kind of religious practice which may be referred to here consisted of
Tāntric ritual and worship
A distictive characteristic of Hindu pūjā is that, in essence, It is a personal activity rather than a congregational or communal performance For a Hindu, pūjā is an individual experience, it is an act of private devotion Temple-worship is, of course, not uncommon but it cangot be said to be an essential constituent of Hindu religious practice The piety of a Hipdu is by no means dependent on his visiting a temple and offering worship there Indeed, many devout Hindus prefer home-worship to temple worship It may, however, be noted that the basic pattern of temple worship is more or less the same as the one indicated above Naturally enough, in temple-worship, the devotees have usually to be content with besog mere spectators of rather than active participants in the procedure of worship Even in the case of home-worship it is only one member of the family who offers worship for the whole family Thus, in the ultimate analysis, the individual&rsquo;s part in worship is limited mainly to his own contem plation of and prayer to the divinity In this connection a special mention must be made of japa or the repeated murmuring of the Dame of the god which is believed to possess deep religio-magical siguificance As for prayer, the religious man seeks to establish, by means of it, a living communion with god conceived AS

141
personal and present in experience It jmplies, on the one hand, an unfiloching faith in god&rsquo;s grace, and, on the other, one&rsquo;s complete surrender to his mercy
Scch udividual worship is perhaps of greater spintual valge, bat there is no doubt that the absence of any obligatory worship of a congregatiopal type has, to a certain extent, adversely affected the religio-social cohesion and integration among the Hindas, Hinduism certainly provides for such religious affairs of a communal nature as the recital and exposition of epic and Puranic texts and works of religio-philosophical import, seasonal festival! and pugrimages to sacred places But these cap by no means be $ad to constitute the essentials of religious practice Nor arc they, in any sease, obligatory
Though, as has been pointed out above, the basic pattern of Hindu worship is more or less fixed, there are often made in it dinerous and minute sanations in accordance with the differeot cults, different divinities, and different occasions Indeed one often wonders shether the diversity of Hindu worship does not actually exceed the duersity of Hodu doctrine A reference to the ritual and worship sponsored by the Tantra schocks would be quite relevant at this stage The Tantric ntual and worstup are more rigorously organized than the normal Hindu ritual and worship The Tantras do not make any distinction in the matter of religious practice on the basis of caste and sex Their ritoal is essennally of an esoteric character and its knowledge is usually trasismitted and preserved through a strict teacher-pupil tradition It comprises of various sexual orgiastic, and bloody rites One of the basic assumptions of the Tantras relates to the almost organic correspondence between man and the universe, and, on the strength of this assumption, the practitioner of Tantric rites Seeks to control the universe through the control of his own body
ne Taptras also emphasize the religio-magical potence of such Ilems of worsbup as mantra, Janira, bija, etc. Indeed, the Tantras pelieve in magically compelling the divine powers rather than religiously propitiating them,142

• It has been stated elsewhere that, from the strict philosophical point of view, god is only relatively real, that is to say, he is real only on the phenomenal plane Worship of god cannot, accord. ingly, be regarded as of ultimate spiritual value The Brhadă ranjaka-Upanisad (1 4 10) for instance, says “Whoever worships another divinity (than his self) thinking that he (god) is one and he himself another, he knows not&rdquo; Actually the same Upanisadie passage further suggests that gods do not like that men should know the ultimate truth of transcendental unity, for then they would know gods to hold but a subordinate position and so cease offering worship to them Notwithstanding this predominating philosophical attitude which tends to look upon all rules, rites, and creeds as being part of a lower and temporal order of things, the Hindu is normally not half hearted in respect of his worldly obligations His devotion to god and his zeal and earnestness in the matter of worship cannot brook being called in question The worship of god reflects his genuine response to the supreme reality as conceived on the empirical plane ma response of sear, hope, love, and trust
Hindu worship is also fegarded as an efficacious means of moral discipline aod spiritual fortification which human life so badly needs Indeed, Hindu worship has a very wide connota tion It does not necessarily imply some deliberate act of devotion As (de Bhagavadgitá proclaims, one who perfornis his prescribed duties exclusively for the sake of lokasamgraha and without being selfishly attached to their fruits must be deemed to be offering the most devout and the most agreeable worship to god Whatever one does in the spirit of true anāsah Ir-yoga is in essence an act of worship - The doctrine of grace must, indeed, be regarded as an essen tial constituent of theistic ideology Some intimation of this doctrine may be discovered in such Rgvedic references as that Varuna chosc Vasistha for his exclusive companionship and, through his mijesty, made him a true scer (Vir 88 4) But it takes its appearance in a fairly developed form for the first time, only in the later religiously oriented Upanisais Already in

143
the Katha-Upanisad (II 23) we are told that this supreme self &ldquo;canoot be attained by instruction, nor by intellectual power por even through much hearing He is to be attained only by the one whom he chooses' The Vundaka-Upanısad (III 2. 3) repeats the same very But the Stelāraldra-Upanisad is perhaps more expiat on ibus point At one place ( I 6), for instance, it says that the self blessed by the Lord the Moser (prerur), gains Life eterdal, while at another (ITI 20) it actually speaks of drātuh prasāda or the grace of the creator
The doctrine of grace forms an integral part of the teaching of the Bhagavadgita One of the principal attributes of god in the Bhagaradgira is lose for his devotee Indeed, god is said to be the friend of all beings (V 29) and to be actisely helping man in freemg bimself from the somsāra Several times in the poem, Lord Krsna is seen to have assured Arjuna that &ldquo;for one who attams to him there does not remain any re-birth’ (VIII 16 ) Mainly through god&rsquo;s grace does one in the eternal immutable realm So, almost by way of his final precept Krsna urges Arjuna to relinquish all the religious duties and betake burself only to him He alone sball deliver him from all sins whatsoever (XVIII 66)
Io the cpics, and more particularly in the Purānas, divine grace is a frequently occurring religious motif God is said to have assumed finite forms for the sake of the love for his worshippers and in order to free them from the shackles of this worldly existence in the Pancarātra scriptures, this fonction of freeipg the devotee from the sausāra is ascribed to the sudarsana portion of Laksmi, the transcendent chara cter of the supreme lord himself being thereby scrupulously maintained The sudarsana is represented as operating like god&rsquo;s grace and as gradually leading the sell on the way to mohsa or dcineracce However, it may be incidentally pointed out that,
as god is endowed with the attribute of anugraha or grace he is also endowed with the attribute of nigraha or the power of obstruction by means of which be keeps man bound down to samsāra In the course of the further development of the
144
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
Vaisnava theism, the doctrine of grace became so basic a theme of its teaching that it came to be unequivocally claimed, as, for instance, in the Narājaniya, that one could attain religious enlightenment not through penance or knowledge or the like, but only as the result of the compassion of Nārāyana 19 The Bhāga. vata Purana glorifies the grace of god as the very crown and consummation of religion. God is god by nature, but man, who is man by nature, can become god by nature through the grace of god The Ārvars sing of god as being condescendingly merciful even to the lowliest among men and bestowing on him his grace
Rāmānuja, who seeks to give a philosophical foundation to the theistic ideology, has to encounter the problem of the co ordination of the two concepts, namely, the grace of god and the law of Karma With reference to the statement in the Kausitakr Upanısad ( II 8) that &lsquo;this one that is, the supreme being), truly, causes him, whom he wishes to lead up from these worlds, to perform good actions, this one, indeed, also causes him, whom he wishes to lead downward to perform bad actions,&rsquo; he seems to suggest that god&rsquo;s grace does not operate arbitrarily but that it does so in accordance with the law of Karma This does not, however, imply that the law of Karma is something external to or independent of god It is itself the expression of god&rsquo;s mode of action God is the source and substratum of both grace and law of Karma There is, therefore, no question of one of these two being subservient to the other God often employs the law of Karma as a kind of testing erercise for one to whom grace is to be ultimately shown As hinted at in the Bhagavadgita (VI 41-43), the samsära, which is the inevitable consequence of the law of Karma, is inteoded to allord to man an opportunity to qualify himself for god&rsquo;s grace, for moksa in other words, man is subjected to the law of Karma because of god&rsquo;s desire to show him grace and not in spite of it A reference may be made, in this very context, to the two major schools of the Vaisnava theology propounded by Rámānuja The southern school or the

world process, as has been already pointed out, is an unending cycle of emanations and reabsorptions, and the aim of religion is some kind of union or close association of the soul with god beyond that cycle It is also suggested that, through deep contemplation of god, one actually becomes either god or like god But, generally, in the Hindu theism, moksa is not under stood either as union with or fusion into or identification with god It rather means isolation - the isolation of the self from all other things such as the world and the other selves It is, indeed, the isolation of the soul in its essence This kind of liberation is believed to be more desirable than either the annihilation of the soul or its absorption into the vaster spirituality of Brahman The soul is eternal, it has its true being beyond time and space It is just in this sense that the soul is said to participate in divine Dature And, thus participating in divine nature, it persists even to the state of liberation Freed from evil of all kind and having attained all desires, through the grace of god, the soul becomes isolated from the associations of the manifested world, and yet continues to experience the unending and ever increasing love of god
All Hindu mysticism aims at the transcendence of personality by the soul, eitber through the realisation of complete unity with the universal spirituality or through the total isolation of the eternal in the soul from the temporal in it There has however, been often mentioned still another type of mysticism, namely, loving communion with god even during the state of embodied existence it is in diew of this that one speaks of &lsquo;impersonal&rsquo; mysticism and personal mysticism But, in the ultimate analysis, the experience of mysticism is essentially uniform though that experience is expressed in different ways, such as, through silence or negation or contradiction or superlation Hindu mysticism transcends the tyranny of words usually encouraged by philosophie cal dogmas or religious doctrines It is, indeed, from its mysticism that Hinduism has defiscd its unique attitude of tolerance
In the history of Hinduism mao s attitude towards god has undergone many changes However, three principal landmarks

may be specially noted in this connection in the early Vedic period, man sought to exert on gods a kind of magically compal sive influence by means of his word (brehran or mantra) and 2ction (Jajña or ritual) In the t&rsquo;panised c penod, lcosledge of god-or, to be more precise, of the suprece being-came to be regarded as the only source of salvatica ard eteroal 6!155 - though, incidentally, even then, the magic potence of knowledge was duly emphasized To Loon was to attain - indeed, to knon was to become Desire for knowledge, respect for knowledge, and trust in the practical religio-philosophical eficacy of Iton ledge - these continued to be the distinctive features of Hinduism throughout its bistory Tbi Knowledge-partial attitude of the Hirdu was often camed to such an extreme that he got ogoften posited and logically spbstantiated a religion without a god, and persisted in regarding ignorance as a more gneious sin than even the most senous moral lapse It is, indeed on account of this that Hinduism is frequently - though not always justifiably - characterised as &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo; rather than spirituality
With popular Hinduism, bhalni or passionate devotion to god became the watch ord of religion Blala Cecessarly presupposes the belief m a personal god, who is ofted a diuinity of a popular cult elevated to the status of the supreme being. Before this personal god, man erperiences the feeling of moral mferionty, spiritual imperfection, belplessdess and humility He, Lowever, has unquestioned faith in the grace of god, and, therefore, surrenders before him in a completely self-oblivious manner hop ing thereby to achieve a direct moustic communion with bum which, for a bhalla, cons'&lsquo;utes the ultimate spiritual goal. Some traces of this emotional theism may be discovered in a few hymns of the Rgreda, particularly those addressed by Vasstha to Varuna, but 10 15 in the Sretāstatara- cansad that it seems to have been first formulated into a religious doctrine 1 The rise of various Hirdo sects are a flip to the growth of Maha, and the Porīnic uradi tion that braku was born in the Dravidian country gets bistorical&rdquo;

confirmation from the fact that the two principal and more or less parallel currents of early medieval theism, pamely, Vaişna vism and Saivism, had their main spring in southern India
The religion of bhalı generally substituted theology for mythology, but its most outstanding achievement was that it sought to establish the equality of all persons, irrespective of caste, creed, and sex, in the sight of god Of course, both mythology and social distinctions proved too tenacious to be so easily stifled The role of bhakti in the history of Hinduism may be said to have been self-contradictory On the one hand, the doctrine of bhakti served as a unifying force among the Hindu masses who were rallied together, under the banner of religious equality and brotherhood, to counteract the exclusivism of Vedism-Brahmanism, while, on the other hand, the various sects which sponsored that doctrine, each in its own way, tended, in course of time, to consolidate themselves into different castes and thereby encourage the fissiparous trends in the Hindu society
And now to revert to the question with which we started, pamely, whether the belief in god can be generally said to consti. tute the primary principle of Hinduism Hindu thinkers, as will have been seen, do not start with the certainty of god They seem
to accept god only as a hypothesis which is not unworkable The historical process of the phenomenal world and man are not dependent on god, on the contrary, gods themselves are believed to be subject to some universal law like the law of Karma The concept of god 18 thus by no means central to Hinduism The Hindu thinker begins with the experience which is most immediato to him, namely, the self He construes god and the phenomenal world with reference to the self-though, it must be emphasized, bis Weltanschauung has not thereby become anthropocentric The German philosopher FEUERBACHI says &ldquo;God is my first thought, the world my next, and man my thurd and last &quot; In his religious qucst, the Hindu thinker must be said to have proceeded the other way round

attempts are seen to bave been made by man, even in the ipfapcy of the human race, to explażn the origin and development and the plan and structure of the world which surrounded him and which naturally aroused his interest, in other words, to evolve some kind of cosmogonical myth Indeed, it is difficult to imagine any period in the history of man when he had not formu &ldquo;lated a cosmogonical myth It should also be remembered that the cosmogonical notions of man have always influenced and are often reflected in his ritual The parallelism between myth and ritual must never be lost sight of while studying any ancient religion
To begin with what I have elsewhere characterised as the protohistoric Hinduism, we have to admit that hardly any material has become available which would help us to visualise its cosmology cosmograpy The evidence brought forth by archaeological excavations for the reconstruction of the material civilization of the protohistoric period of India&rsquo;s history is DO doubt fairly rich, but attention bas also been appropriately drano to the notorious incapacity of material symbols to represent the true contents and aflidity of a religion or belief&rsquo;s Notwith standing this, some speculations regarding the beliefs of the Indus people about the universe, particularly from the eschatological point of view have been hazarded on the basis of very meagre and obviously unconvincing evidence It has, for instance, been suggested that the Indus people believed in a sky-world or rather in a solar world, to which the spirits of the dead were supposed to repair after death An ellipsoid urn recovered from the cemetery at Harappa ( denoted by H 206 b) is presumed to depict a funeral Scene It is claimed that the therianthropic figure (the upper part of the body being that of a peacock and the lower one that of a man) shown standing between the animals represents the subtle body (sük sma sar ra) of the dead person and the animals his guides to the land of bliss or the solar world Another burial um

One finds oneself on a surer ground shen one comes to the age of the Veda. The Vedic interature is fortunately rich in speculations relating to the various aspects of the subject of the opiverse Broadly speaking, prayers and mythological traditions constitute the principal content of the Rgreda But the Rgvedic poet-priests have by no means ignored cosmogony, which, as a matter of fact, often represents the first manifestation of religious thought. Their cosmogonical speculations either form part of the general pattern of their mythology or are expressed in the form of independent cosmogonical myths Naturally enough, we conot speak of any single uniform cosmogonical theory of the Rgreda as such. It would seem that various explanations about the origin and nature of the universe were put forth though Aone of them had been finally confirmed Further, it has been rightly suggested that any particular cosmogonical theory has to be related to the man and not to the age It also needs to be remembered that these various theories are by do means mutually exclosite One more thing In my various writings I have consistently advocated the view that the major roythology of the Rgreda is essentially evolutionary in character 10 I must, however, state here that, uolike the Kgredic mythology, the cosmogony

A mention may be made at this stage of a few more points, which, as a matter of fact, may be said to apply to Hindu cosmo gony as a whole According to the Rgveda, creation is not a single definite act - it is regarded as ever proceeding &quot; It is a process and not a single event But, unlike the Purana cosmo. logy, the Vedic cosmology does not speak of repeated creations A Vedic poet asserts that the heaven and the earth have been created but once RV VI 48 22 tells us sahrdd ha dy aur ajājata sahrd bhūmir ajájala In the Rgvedic passage, sūryācandramasau drātā jathāpūrsam akalpajat, etc (X 190 3), the word yatha. pūrvam has to be understood in the sense, “according to the proper order &quot;&rdquo; This is confirmed by the reference in the Vajasaney, Samhita (40 8), Jāthatathyalo &lsquo;rthân ny adadhat Secondly, the concept of creation er nihilo is practically unknown to Hiodu thought As a matter of fact such a concept is gene rally not to be found in any of the ancient cosmogopies Crea. tion usually implies the transformation of the potential into the actual or the establishment of cosmos in the place of chaos It is, indeed, in this latter sense that the Rta is often characterised as the source of the phenomena djävā ha k samā prathame rienā &lsquo;bhıśrāve bhavatah (RV X 12 1) In the only Rgvedic passage, which seems to suggest that something was produced out of Dothing, namely, devānām pūrvje juge &lsquo;saiah sad jāj ata (X, 72 2) the word asal actually means. primordial non-differentia tion or distinctionlessness&rsquo; rather than norbing. 18 And, thirdly, Vedic cosmogony does not have any teleological significance

The creator, whenever be is mentioned, is hardly ever represented as haizog beer caosed by aos idea of executing any deliberate plan. It is perhaps on account of this that the creator as such does not play any promirent role in Hindu religious thought which rarely concerns itself with the design, object, or purpose of the world
It is well known that the creation of the annerse is ascribed in the RgTeda to various disputes The relevant Rgvedic passages are too many to be septioped bere The creaton of the Odiverse, indeed, constitutes almost an inevitable feature of the full-ledged mythological personalities of the Vedic gods The cosmological activity of the Vedic gods is often described as a work of art and is commonly expressed through the Cetaphors of building&rsquo;, 101ping, &lsquo;neavog&rsquo;, &lsquo;mooldog&rsquo;s etc ! Such references, however, have so many cases, merely a rhetorical rather than cosmogonial import It may be empha sized, at this stage, that, broadls spealing, in Vedic anythology, the Cosmogonical themes and the legends of god, do not show any organic unity There do, honeer, exist, in Rgvedic mythology, some divinities which are more or less exclusively connected with the creative activity Among these a special refereace deserves to be made to Tiastr and Yaralarman Tv2str was originally regarded as having been responsible for the creation of the All verse, but when, in the evolutionary mythology of the Rgveda, history was mythologised and the human hero Indra was trans formed into a cosmic god, he usurped Tvastrs function as the creator za the same way as he usurped Tnta Aptya&rsquo;s function as the raid-god Is It has also been suggested that Trastr must have bem Jonged to extra-Vedic tradition, that the Rbhus wer: represented u the Rgreda as bis friendly nsals, and that, after he had been ditested of his cosmolagical functions, he became a fertiuty-god and a god of handicraft.1 As for Vivakaroo, his personality

scems to have resulted from a conscious effort to represent a unity of godhead through the creatorship of the universe 17
A tendency has also become evident in recent years to see in the Indra Vitra-fight an Original Aryan myth of creation 19 It is pointed out that Indra slays with his vajra the power of resistance of the inert chaos (1rtra). splits the primordial mountain on which Vrtra was residing and thereby brings out the goods of life symbolised by fire (Agni-Surya) and water (Apah-Soma) By slaying Vitra, Indra also separates the heaven from the earth, which event represents an early stage in the process of creation This view is slightly modified by KUIPER19 who has suggested that the Indra-Vrtra-fight reflected only the second stage in the process of creation Waters represented the beginning of the universe Within those waters, there emerged the primordial mountain Indra directed his assaults against this mountain which had been Vstra&rsquo;s abode, slew Vitra, and thereby advanced the cosmogonical process KUIPER wonders whether all this cannot be construed as just a macrocosmic projection of a necessarily individual recollection of the embryogonic experience Indra&rsquo;s great creation act, he further asserts, 20 is repeated every morning and leads up every year, at the time of the winter solstice, to a new crisis &lsquo;21 It would, however, seem that the cosmogonical traits in the Indra mythology were not original but that they were superimposed on it at a later stage in the evolution of Indra&rsquo;s personality and character as a part of the mythologisa. tion of history Indra is obviously a newcomer in Vedic mytho

logy-he is ánujāvara-and there must have been in vogue some cosmogonical myth even before Jadra care to be glonfied as the supreme god of the Rgieda As has been already indicated, Indra must have superseded his father&rsquo; or &lsquo;grandfather&rsquo; Trastr and must have thereby talen over to himself the cosmogodical func uoos of the latter
As agalost Indra&rsquo;s, Yamna s role in the cosmological act must be regarded as more basic and essential There occurs in the Rgreda a rather obscure - but, for our present purpose, a highly significant-reference to lama RIX 13 4 reads

There is ample euidence in the Rgredo to show that Yama was a god RV I 83 5, for instance, speaks of Jamasja jalam amrtam As such he was entitled to immortality (amirtatra) Notwithstanding this Yama, we are told, opted for death - be surrendered his own dear body in the sacrifice of the gods for the sake of procreation Yama sas a god man - an immortal who willingly suffered death.

characterised by the self-immolation of a god-man and which was intended for prajā (procreation ) 23
An extended version of this cosmogonical speculation occurs in the famous Purusa-Sūkta (RV X 90) The Purusa, whose characterisation as purusa suggests his humanness but whose epithets, amirtatasya icana, etc, clearly indicate his divideness, was, like Yama, a god-man in the primeval sacrifice of the gods, the principal oblation was this Purusa bimself (purusena havisa derā jajñan alamata) The various parts of the universe (as also of the human society) issued out from the various limbs of the sacrificed primal person
Attention may be drawn to another significant motif associa ted with the self immolation of the god-man, Purusa or Yama This god-man was also a hermaphrodite - being constituted simultaneously of male and female This is suggested by the Purusa-Virāç concept in the Purusa-Suhia and the Yama-Yami concept in the Yama mythology We, thus, have in the Rgreda the cosmogopical theory, according to which thc universe is believed to have been the result of the self immolation of a bermaphrodite god-man It may also be pointed out that the idea of sexual congress of a male and a female as the starting point of the creation of the universe is implied in the relationship between Purusa and Vırāt (X 90 5), Aditi and Daksa (X 72 4), Yama and Yami (X 10), and even Dyauh and Pythivi (VI 70 3)
The Hindus have conceived of the universe as being infinite in time and space Though this notion becomes particularly emphatic only in the post-Vedic literature, we do get some intimations of it even in the Rgreda A reference may be made in this connection to the mythological concept of Aditi who personifies infinity &ldquo;l or eternity 36 or immeosity&rdquo;! or

question is generally raised in respect of the origin of waters themselves Even Višvakarman is said to have been preceded by this primordial substance or substratum 38 Waters were &ldquo;the primitive medium in the womb of which is fashioned everything that exists &ldquo;39 tam id garbham prathamam dadhra apo jatra devāh sam agacchanta viste (RV X 82 6), and the poet of RV X 129 1 asks about them “What was that deep bottomless water?&rdquo; ambhah kim asid gahanam gabhiram 48 Verily, in all periods of the history of Hindu thought, waters have been regarded, in different ways as the material source of the universe According to the Hiranyagarbha sūkta (RV X 121 ), the primal spirit or the highest god, who is later identified with Prajapati, originated in the primeral waters as Hiranyagarbha, the Golden Embryo, which, incidentally, is sometimes described as the principle of fire floating upon waters, and subsequently started the cosmogonical process The Rgvedic Hiranyagarbha may be identified with heranyajetasa - the golden reed - referred to in Atharvaveda X 7 41 Hiranyagarbha may also be related to the myth of Aditi ( who can be equated with primeval waters) and Mārtānda 41 Then there is also the cosmogonical theory (RV X 129 ) that, in the primordial condition which could not be described either as sat because it was uncharacterisable or as asat because it possessed the potentiality of evolving, there arose, at the outset, häma or the original impulse for creation, and this marked the beginning of the subsequent evolution of being Further, in this very content may be mentioned the creative role of sāk 12 As for the cosmogony of the Athanaveda, by and large it speaks of the Prajāpati like highest god conceived under different names and forms such as rolula (XIII 3-4), anadian (IV 11 ), kala (XIX 53-54), kāma (XIX 52), as the creator of the universe

Speculations more or less similar to the Vedic ones c3o be traced in various ancient cosmogonies For mstance, waters are regarded as the primal matter in the Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek cosmogonies The Egyptun and Greek cosmogonies also hare the notion of the cosmic egg. Vedic Kāma may be said to correspond with Greek Eros, and the sexual relationship between the sky and the earth is referred to i Hebrew cosmogony It may also be pointed out that unlike Vedic cosmogony, the ancient Iranian cosmogony is one of opposition. The entire cosmic process, according to the latter, consists of a senes of beneficent creations by Ahura Mazdab and malebcent counter creatious by Ahrimao
Very little has been said in the Agreda about the actual process and order of the creation of the universe A reference may, however, be made in this consection to a couple of passages In one rather obscure passage ( 72 3-4) we are told 10 the first cpoch of the gods, sat tras born from asor,&rsquo; after it (sat) onginated the world-regions (asāh), and that one subsequent to the couchant ( utlänapad what this ultārapad denotes is oot at all clear 14, the earth was bom from the couchant and from the earth onginated the world-regions Elsewhere (X. 190 1-2) 1t 15 sard Rta and sarja ongated from tapas, from it (it is not clear what this it' denotes, or does tarah mean thereafter'?) the night, and therefrom the agitatug ocean, from the agitating ocean was bom the year (perhaps, symbolising time), which, rulog over all that wils, organizes days and nights I think that the abstruse Rgvedic stanza (X 27 23 ), deraram mare prathamā atisham, etc., also refers to the process and order of the creation of the universe

<p>An essential feature of Vedic – indeed, of the entire Hindu - cosmography is the system of lokas' or worlds or cosmographical regions There is, however, to be seen considerable vagueness, inconsistency, and confusion about the various details regarding these lokas For instance, the conflicting Vedic statements in respect of the number of lokas constituting the universe cannot be reduced to any kind of uniformity Usually the Vedic poets speak of a dual division of the universe The universe is said to be constituted of dyaus (heaven) and prthivi (earth) Inciden tally, the word dyaus is translated both as &lsquo;sky&rsquo; and beaven' However, in the Vedic contexts, I prefer the rendering heaven' The word svarga, which is invariably employed in later literature to denote heaven, occurs but once in the Rgveda (X. 75 18) The Vedic poets express the idea of the whole universe through the mention of the heaven and the earth together - however, not uncommonly in contradictory terms, such as that the heaven and the earth are the parents of gods and that they are generated by gods 8
It was believed that the heaven and the earth were originally joined together This is faintly suggested in several Rgvedic passages - but is more clearly stated in the Brāhmanas For instance, the Altareja-Brāhmana (IV 27) says imou vai lokaut saha astām. They were subsequently separated and held apart One of the features of the enforcement of the cosmic law by Varuna

The separation of the heaven and the earth from each other resulted ja tbe emergence of antariksa or the midregron. Indra is said to have measured out the midregion wider jo antarik sam vi mame varījah (RV II 122) It is, indeed, sugges ted that coming toto being at creation consisted largely un being able to pass between the heaven and the earth
The references in the Rgveda to the three lokas (Worlds or regions ), namely, djaw (beaveo ), antariksa (mdregion), and prihm ( earth ),are so frequent that one is inclined to think that the Vedic Aryans rather assumed a tripartite division of the Universe.

parama, 11 while the earth is upara12 or Asam 13 Sometimes these three worlds are mentioned and then one of the three is addition ally mentioned in the same passage 11 There are also indications that three of one of these three worlds, for instance, three dāvah or three prthiyah, are made to denote the whole universe It would seem that Hindu cosmographical speculations were greatly influenced by the numbers &lsquo;three&rsquo; and &lsquo;seven&rsquo; by the number
three' generally in the Vedic texts and by the number &lsquo;seven&rsquo; 10 the Puranas The Vajasaneji-Samhuta ( 8 60) mentions the usual three lokas, namely, dyaus, antariksa, and prthivi, and further adds jam ham ca lokam, thus suggesting the possibility of the existence of more than those three lokas Nāka or the firmament or the heavenly vault15 is sometimes mentioned besides the usual triad as a region higher than that triad 16 The purpose of nāka seems to have been to hold the stars or to serve as the basis of the heavenly ocean which encompasses the whole world A passage in the Atharraveda (IV 14 3) seems to speak of a realm of celestial light (svar potih) as a region further beyond nāka (dno nākasya prsthåt svar otir agām aham) However, the turizam drāma referred to in RV IX 96 19 does not seem to possess any cosmographical significance, though Sāyana, and following him LUDWIG and GELDNER, understand the phrase as denoting the moon
The number three has been exploited by the Rgvedic poets in connection with their cosmography in various other ways For instance, apart from the heaven, the midregion, and the earth, they speak of three heavens (djavah) and three earths (bhumin) making up a sixfold pattern ( sadrdhanah),17 or of three earths (bhūmih) and three higher regions ( uttarant),18 or of three carths (bhumih) and three realms of light (rocană), or of three realms

The expression sal ursih, sus Wide ones, occurs in the Rgreda three times, 21 but is none of these passages docs its exact signifi cance become clear It may be presumed that sal urtih more or less correspond with the sad rajámsı of RI&rsquo;I 164 6 and represent the six #7de regions #bich make up the uniterse, for, it is asserted that do world custs outside of the sol urtih na räbhyo bhuanam kaccanā &rsquo;re (RV VI 47 3) They may thus be understood to denote the three heavens and the three earths referred to above But Sīyana, commenting on RV X 128 5, says that the sit us are, according to the scripture (presumably, the Asfalājana Sraulasūtra 1 2 3 and Sankhāj ana-Srautajūtra 1 64), dy aw, pathiri, day, night, waters, and plants Honever, the Satapatha. Brāhmana, which is the oldest text explaining the term sad ursih, speaks ( 5 22 ) of agrih, prthiri, apah, rajah, ahah, aod rärnk, while elsewhere dy aus, prikri, ápah, osadhajah, ürk, and sünrtā are also mentioned in this connection Obviously, all this is quite formulaic In a passage to the Atharrarede (VIII 9 16), $ix dj žāprthrris and sux urris are mentioned side by side perhaps in syntactic parallelism

shiding in the middle')?&rdquo; – is self-evident The concept of loka in the Veda has been studied in great detail by Professor GONDA,2% and it has been shown, among other things, that loka, originally connected with light, represents, more particularly, &lsquo;a place or position of religious or psychological interest&rsquo;, or a place which has come into contact with &ldquo;power&rdquo; , or &lsquo;room to exist in freely and without hindrance and obstruction&rsquo; It has been further stated that the term loka denotes &lsquo;the diversification of the primordial cosmic unity&rsquo; Similarly it has been shown that in the ultimate analysis, the term bhavana may be understood in the sense of the whole aggregate of what has come and is coming into being * 24 In the Rgveda, the word rajas, when used 10 singular, denotes the midregion, when used in plural, it depotes the worlds or regions in general That word is derived from the Indo-European reg &lsquo;to stretch out,&rsquo; and originally means &lsquo;that which has been stretched out ** space&rsquo;, and more specifically the space above the earth Heinrich ZIMMER assumes2s the existeoce of a rajas beneath the earth to account for the sun&rsquo;s course from the west towards the east during the night in this connection, be refers to the Rgvedic passages, such as, VI 91, VII 80 1, and IX 68 3 But this is rather far-fetched Most of the Rgvedic passages, in which the word rajas occurs, clearly point to the region or regions above the earth But the word seems to have eventually acquired a special sease The portion of the upper space attached to the earth was darker than the one which was attached to the heaven The former came to be known as rajas and the latter as rocana The phrase krsna rajas is not

It is interesting to note that ison (ks , grā) earth is Inguístically related to lat hurris earth ard homohonan beug,' thus perhaps suggesting that the earth is the place suitable for human habitation Later scbolasts, however, explain that the earth is called ksma, ksara, because she bears patiently (samate) The exact derivation of the Ford roke is uncertain. It is etymologally coopected with *na?. &lsquo;skin,&rsquo; bude,' *corer. ing,' and its meaning heavenly vault', &lsquo;firmament is thereby sought to be confirmed There by also the new that the word räka is to be related to such words as upala, wala, ete, which are indicative of directors, and that it is to be then explained as
that to which one points upwards&rsquo; It is suggested that the helen is sometimes called amar. (RV V 30 8, 56 4) (f. Persian-Hindi asmān=sky, heaven) because of its resemblance to a stone -vault. It, however, seems more likely that the heaven is called asman, because it bears the asman or the clouds. The word asan primarily means &lsquo;rock, but, in the Rgveda, it is also used in the sense of cloud&rsquo; (cf RV II 12. 3), because black clouds look like huge rocks It is from this very pont of view that the heaven is abo called rabhas &ldquo;clocd-bedecked,' the word rabhas originally harag the sense of cloud

1 The word rodasī is variously derived It is suggested that the original word is rodas (neut), which may have meant earth 28 The word rodas is connected with lat rudis raw', &lsquo;wild&rsquo; and rullus rustic' and may imply the grossness and ruggeddess of the earth as compared to the other two lokas Rodasi is then explained as an elliptical dual denoting both the heaven and the earth 29 A reference may be made here, in passing, to the word visa, which, as a substantive, depotes &lsquo;all,&rsquo; everything' That word seems to imply an &lsquo;organic whole. According to GONDA, visva means analytical and enumerative totality, as against sarva which connotes synthetical totality, completeness, wholeness, integrity 34 Attention may also be drawn, in this very context, to the various pairs of opposites, such as jagar lasthus, jagat sthātr, jät-avasıta, divja-părthna, darvja mānusa, jivaloka amriasya loka, each of which pairs denotes &lsquo;all being 31
It has been already pointed out that the Vedic poets often think of Dyāvāppthivi as a single mythological entity Dyāvā. prthivi (also referred to as dyarák sämā, dj āvābhūmi, or rodası) play not an unimportant role in Vedic mythology Six whole hymns in the Rgreda are addressed to this dual divinity, and it is also mentioned in over 100 isolated passages Dyāvāprthivi are celebrated as the primeval parents (pūnaje pitară RV VII 53 2, X 65 8) - as the cosmic father and mother (pitä mätä сa bhuva nânı rak satah, RVI 160 2, or djaur me pitā jantā nābhir atra bandhur me māta prthivi mahi &ldquo;yam, RV I 164 33 ) 31 But, as has been already pointed out unlike in many ancient mythologies, the character of Father Sky and Mother Earth as the basic cultic

figures was not sufficiently developed in Vedic mythology ** Dyavāprthivi are said to have given birth to the gods - they are deraputre par excellence 34 - though they are also sometimes said to have been gederated by the gods However, in the Rgreda, there is hardly any direct reference to the marriage between Dyats and Prthuvi, such as the one which he meet with, perhaps for the first time, la the Aitare) a-Brahmana IV 27 (au samsanlar etam derarirāham r ai aherăm lodeed, there is not much sex symbolism in tbe Rgvedic mythology relating to Dyāsāpsthivī, except perhaps as implied in a couple of passages like ni mātara FLIJ ani retase bhuje (RLI 155 3 “He, that is, Visou, leads the two parents to the enjoyment of the semen&rdquo;) or jurok sıktā FIStripānı sarrolá (RV VI 70 3 &ldquo;The semen of jou two gives rise to the multiform beiogs which follow the selfsame ordi Dance&rdquo;). The references im RY I 71 5,2 61 5-7 to the 1acest of a father with his daughter presomably relate to the myth of Dyaus and bus daughter Usas rather than to Dyaus and Prthivi as suggested by some scholars The latter are together called pilara or mătară or svasarā Dyáváprthivi are further said to support all things (19) am imanā bibhrtah RI I 185 1) and proiect all beings (apı ra jošā janimāni raste, RV II 38 8) Horcier, their mythological growth was manifestly arrested even 13 the Rgreda and they are more or less completely subordinated in Vedic ritual
The Rgvedic poets seem to seek deliberately to establish the equality of the two components of this daal divinity For instance, one of them asks, Latarā pirtā katarā parā &lsquo;joh (RV I 185 1) &quot; Which one of these two is earlier, which later?&rdquo;, Perhaps implying thereby that both hase emerged simgltaneously Both have also grown together ( sākamsrdhā, RV IX 683) Further, Dyāvāpribiyi are measured up and are found to be

similar in measurement ( sam mātrābhur mamire jemur uni, RV III 38 3) They are also represented as kissing the navel of the world together (RV I 185 5) The heaven and the earth are viewed as the two halves&rsquo; (ubhāv ardhau bharatah sādhū asmai, RV II 27 15 )- they are like two bowls turned towards each other (mah camā samici, RY III 55 20 ) or like two wheels at the two ends of an axle (ak sene &lsquo;la cakrijā, RV X 89 4) or like dlısanäs or shells&rsquo; (samicine dhuisane, RV X. 44 8, AV XX 94 8) Incidentally, these passages may be said to embody the Vedic poet&rsquo;s notions regarding the shape of the heaven and the earth The collaborative activity of Dyāvāprthivi is suggested by the statement that the rains (from the heaven) stimulate the earth and the fires (presumably the ritual fires from the earth ) the heaven bhumim parjanja jinvanti, dnam jimanty agnayah (RV I 164 51 ) 36 The rains are described as the springs of the heaven ( divah utsåh, RV V 57 1) 37
Dyaus by itself does not play any important role in the Rgseda - as a matter of fact, not a single hymo is addressed to Dyaus exclusively The only important feature of the mythology relating to Dyaus is his cosmic fatherhood, though, strangely enough, in about twenty Rgvedic passages, the word djaus occurs as a feminine noun It may be recalled that, even as the cosmic father Dyaus has not been elevated to the same exalted position as his other Jodo-European counterparts like Zeus and Jupiter ** Generally, functions of only a secondary character are seen to have been attributed to him The Ravedic poets seem to have thought of Dyaus as not being static but as moving in its course, ** and also as having boundaries 40 The Võjasaneyl-Samutā (862)

speaks of an eightfold estension of Dyaus A couple of passages in the Rgreda imply that Dyaus surpasses Pythivi, though, as indicated above, some kind of equality is sought to be established between the two
Four points of cosmographical significance emerge from the Rgredic-Atharvasedic descriptions of djous Firstly, the associa tion of dj aus with light and resplendence becomes evident from the termo dzaus itself It is again obviously with reference to this very characteristic that Indra is mentioned as fastefing the rūpa ‘formn' on djaust? or that djaus is said to unfold its form. Secondly, the shape of djous is indicated in a passage in the Atharraseda (X 8 9) which implicitly refers to it as a goblet with its mouth below and bottom upwards (tiragbılaś camasa urdhrabudhnah) Thirdly, the position of dy aus is said to be far away and at a great height It Is, for instance, suggested that dj aus ly the roof of the world held up without beams (aramse dyām astabhājad brhantam, RV I 15 2) At the same time, Vedic poets speak of de aus as havjag been supported with props As the supporters of dy aus are variously mentioned, among others, Indra,&rdquo; Rsabha,47 Savitr,4% and A. Frequently referen ofs are also made to sānu, 50 prstha,2 mrürdlian, sumont, &lsquo;pinnacle&rsquo; of dy aus, as also to the climbing up to dy aus 5 Other termes used in similar contexts are paráraták and ristapa.

According to him, both in the Veda and the Avesta, the heaven was conceived as a great stone building filled with light, through whose doors and windows that light shone upon men 10 the form of the sun and the stars 57 of course, there is very little evidence available in the Rgveda to support this view It is also said that the gods Maruts live in dyaus 68 It is perhaps also the Maruts who, in another passage (RV VI 2 11), are referred to as the heroes of dy aus
The fourth point of cosmographical significance is more note worthy Besides the notion of the three heavens mentioned above, the Rgreda also seems to have the notion of a threefold division of dy aus, pamely, uttama &lsquo;highest,&rsquo; madhyama&rsquo;middlemost, god avama &lsquo;lowest &lsquo;, (jad uitame maruto madhyame vă vad jā &lsquo;vame subhagāso do stha, RV V 60 6) A passage in the Atharvaveda speaks of the aiamā djaus as being rich in water, the madhyamna dyaus as being rich in pilu, and the third or the highest dyaus (pradjaus) as the place where the fathers dwell (udan ati dyaur aramā pīlumati &lsquo;t1 madhyamā, irtijā ha pradyaur iti pasjām pitara asore, AV XVIII 2 48) The meaning of pilu, in this context, is uncertain &ldquo;The commentator understands the word in the sepse of stars &lsquo;68 Compared to the mention of a threefold heaven, that of the three heavens is more common In one passage, it is specifically stated that two of the heavens copstitute the Jap of Savity, while one is in Yama&rsquo;s world (tisro dāvah, savitur dā upastha, ekā samasya bhuvane virāsāt, RV I 35 6) The exact intention of this passage is not quite clear One thing, however, seems certain, namely, that the suggestione that the passage refers to the lowest heaven, which belongs to Yama and which is the ultimate destination of sacrificers, etc, the middle heaven which

There is only one short hymn (consisting of only three stanzas ) in the Rgreda (V 84 ) which celebrates Pithivi. In the Atharvaveda also there is only one hymn to Prthivi (XII 1), but it is very much longer (it consists of sixty-three stanzas) and far more significant than the Rgvedic hymn What strikes one most about the Atharvavedic Pithivi-Sukta 1) that it does not contain mere conventional mytho-poetic cliches or any remote mystic allusions. Through it, the poet seeks to make us feel the direct impact of this concrete tangible earth, on which we live, as acutely as he himself has felt it He speaks, in a purely pragma tic mazoer, of the vital relationship of the visible earth with man. The hymn describes in detail and in a transparent language the physical features of the earth, its extraordinary bounty, its moral ethical foundations, its mythological-ntoal coorections, and above all, its character as the great integrator of the human community Both these hynas clearly show that, in the Veda, Prthivi is more important as locality than as a divinity It is only in a few rare passages, soch as, RV I 115 6 and IV 3.5 (where Prthivi s mentioned along with Mitra, Varuna, Agri, Aditi, etc) and RV II 54 19 (where she is apparently included among Vsre Devāl), that Prthivi is referred to-agd that too, oaly by implication - as a goddess. BAILEY suggests at that the cult of the earth, associa ted with the sky as a productive pair, is of the earlier type of maythopoeia attested in Indo-European languages, and is bedded in a stratum far earlier than the personalised oecarchia of Indra, Visau, etc Vittore PISANI also speaks of an Indo-Germanic earth-goddess However, in the Rgveda, we can hardly trace any cult of the earth as such.67

Attention has already been drawn to the various Vedic words denoting the earth and their significance The earth is, naturally enough, thought of as &ldquo;this loka&rdquo; as against suhrtām loka, trliyam nāka, irtijam jjonih,64 or as against parama loka, 65 or as against
yonder loka *66 The earth is thus distinguished from the other lokas or worlds both from the cosmographical and the ethical. eschatological points of view As for the yonder world, a reference may be incidentally made to the suggestion that the conception of the yonder world as an inverted world where every thing of this world is turned into its opposite is reflected in the legend of Bbsgu&rsquo;s visit to that world ($PBF XI 61, JBr I 42-44) Of course, that legend does not seem to have any ethical sigo ficance
In the beginning the earth is believed to have existed in the form of water upon the ocean of space&rsquo; (yâ &lsquo;rnave &lsquo;dhu sallam agra åsit, AV XII I 8) The wise discovered it by means of their miraculous powers The earth is sometimes viewed, presu mably on account of its position, as the foundation ( dharuna) for the universe 68 It is also pointed out that this earth is the uppermost among the three earths (imā jās tusrah prthivis tāsām ha bhūmir utlanā, AV VI 21 1) The easth is described as caturbhrstid four-cornered&rsquo; and eight peaked 70 As a matter of fact, on the basis of this latter passage which reads, astau vy akhyar kahubhah prihivyās tri dhanva yojanā sapta sindhūn, it is suggested that the earth has eight mountains, three continents,&rdquo; and seven streams The earth is further said to be made up of four quadrants (pradısah )72 and to have seven forms ( dhamani) &quot;

The earth is further said to be wide and yet compact (urri sarī bhumir a mhuranã bhūr, RV VI 47 20 ), spacious and friendly, and not causing any crowding to meo (asanbādha ja ma Jhiato māngrebhrah Vatrájani-Sanhita IV 14 157)
But the earth is not merely &amp; conglomeration of rocks, stones, trees, etc It is not only a physical enpty, it also has a distinct moral-ethical character in the famous hymn to Prthivi (AVXII 1), the Atharvasedic poet speaks of truth, Rta, penance, $acrifice, etc, being the true foundation of the earth (st 1) He, however, whes really eloqueat while dilatiog upon the bounty and liberality of Prthuvi The earth is noch in food, cows, horses, and other treasures (4, 44 these and similar other numbers Occurring hereafter denote the numbers of staozas D A XII 1) (rudhım buhrati bahudhā guha rasu manim hwanyam prihiti dadātu me, AV XII 1 44)-the brokenup earth is said to give oot tres sures (hsās cit tarrdāna, RV IV 28 5)- and adequately sustatas and strengthens whatever breathes and mores (3), all bipeds and

The Atharvavedic poet further goes on to say that it was on the earth that the gods overcame the Asuras and man&rsquo;s ancestors unfolded themselves (jasjām pūrve pūrvajanā u cakrire, jasyām devă asuran abhy avartavan, AV XII 1 5) Asyinau measured the earth, Visnu bestrode it, and Indra, vanquishing the Dasyus, lorded over it (10, 37) The earth is also said to make the sacrificial ritual possible (jasjâm sado haurdhāne jūpo yasyām ni mijate, AV XII 1 38 )

Finally, the earth is rightly glorified as the essential basis of the life of the human community It is the great gathering place affording full scope to the vigorous activity (18) of man and his varjous organizations such as grāma pranja, sablo, somgrāma, and samuti (56) What is, however, particularly remarkable is that the earth is thoroughly impartial and equally supports all kinds of men - foolish as well as weighty or respectable, good as well as evil ( malam bibhrati gurubhrd bhadrapapasya mdhanam Intık suh, AV XII 1 48) It also integrates people practising different religious rites and speaking different languages (janam bibhrati bahudhā rālasam nānādharmanam, AV XII 1 45) A Rgvedic passage (1 72 9 ) seerns to imply that the earth severed its connections with the gods in order to be able to be more closely associated with men
The third of the normal Vedic world-trad, namely, the midregion, does not figure in the Rgveda with any prominence

The statement that, 10 the primordial condition, there was to rajas (răsid rajah, RV X 129 1 ) presumably refers to the situation when the heaven and the earth were still joued together That the poet should add, in the same passage, that, at that time, there was also to rjoman (=that hich has been separated or beld apart, that us, the heaven ) nould thus seem sigolfcant For, Indra is credited with having measured out antariksa by separating prthivi and dj ou 9 The entire process of the orgination of prthiri, rajas, and djaus out of the primeval ovan is indicated in RV X 149 2 ato bhur ata ă utihitam rajo &lsquo;to digiõprthiri oprathetām It may be noted that the context makes it necessary to understand dj cus for dyöräprther in this passage In set of the cosmographical position of antanksa, it is understandable that the gods are described as moving through the midregion 57 In another signifi cant passage ( RV X 149 1), Sauts, who actually represents but an aspect of Asura Varupa, e&rsquo; is said to have calmed down the faltering earth by means of mets, fastened the heaven in the supportless space, and milked the artariksa which neghed like a horse sarita jantraih prthirim aramnād askambhane saritā djām adrmhar, asram rrã &lsquo;dhuksad dhunim antariksam atūrte baddhom sarila samudram This last activity evidently refers to the pheno menon of rain fallng from the midregion Overspread with throdering clouds It is, howeser, not unlikely, that it refers to the gushung forth of the primeral waters Ode may also note that, in this passage, antariksa is compared to a sea sustained in

another passage, antarik sa is, on the one hand, differentiated from prthivi, while, on the other, it is brought into specially close contact with dy aus prihni nal pārtināt päty amhaso &lsquo;ntarik sam dngar pānı asmān (RV VII 104 23 )
It is only rarely that antariksa is referred to, even by impli cation, as a divinity as such In RV III 54, like Prthivi, Antariksa also is included among the Viśve Devūh (st 19) But there is an interesting, though rather obscure, hymn in the Athariaveda (1 32 ) which seems to glorify antarılsa in a special way The theme of that hymn may as well be said to be the “apotheosis of antariksa &quot; The poet begins by proclaiming that a great mystery is going to be pronounced (mahad brahma sadisj ate I read

<h3 id="lecture-three">Lecture Three</h3>
<p>Today, I should like to begin with a brief excursus on the cosmological-cosmographical speculations of the Brahmana-texts It is said that, when speculation is once set going in the Brāhma. nas, the result of its treod is to lead its followers in an intellectual chaos. This is no doubt a rather harsh indictrcent, but it cannot be said to be altogether upwarranted We have seen that, broadly speaking, three main trends of cosmogonical thought are evident in the early Veda, namely, (1) beginning with a mytho logical figure, (2) beginning with some material praciple, and (3) beginning with some abstract principle AU these three trends are reflected in the Brahmanas but with this noteworthy difference (a) There is a greater emphasis on a single Personal Creator or a more patently cothropomorphic All-God, namely, Prajapati, as being the priocipal character in the cosmogonic drama, (b) the other two trends, namely, of a material principle and an abstract prociple being the starting points of the cosmo gopical process are organically mingled with the basic Praăpatr legend, and (c) all these trends are eventually given a distinct ntualistic onentation It must, however, be conceded that the cosmogonical legends in the Brāhmanas, by and large, tend to confirm the dictum that mythology is a kind of primitsye mctaphysics
Though, as has been pointed out, there is, to the Brāhmanos, an unambiguous stress on abat may be called the personalistic theones of creation there is still no suggestion of the creator having any motive or design for creation He is hardly ever represented as erecuting any deliberate plan. It often seems as if the creator is moved primarily by a desire to allow an outlet to the exuberance of hus energy-by an impulse to moltiply tumself The wbole vanverse thus becomes just a manfestation of some

effusive force Incidentally, it is this attitude which later deve loped into the doctrine that the universe represents but the nila kawalyam
The most typical cosmogonical myth of the Brahmanas has Prajāpati as its central figure SO &lsquo;yam purusah prajāpalır akāmajata | bhūyant sjām prajāzeye &lsquo;ill so &lsquo;frāmjata sa tapo &ldquo;apyata / sah sräntas tepano brahmai &ldquo;va prathamam asrjata trayım eva vidjām sai à &lsquo;smai pratistha &lsquo;bhavat tasyām pratisthāyām pratisthito &lsquo;rapyata / so &lsquo;po &lsquo;srjata vāca eva / so &lsquo;kämajata/ abhyo dolyo &lsquo;dhi prajāycje &lsquo;ri/ so &lsquo;nayā tray vidjajā sahā &lsquo;pah prāvsat / tata andam sam avartala / tad abhy amrsad astv ity astu bhūyo &lsquo;sh aty eva tad abravitatha yo garbho Intarā &lsquo;sit so &lsquo;grir asrjjata (Šatapatha-Br VI 1 1 8 ff) &ldquo;Now this Person Prajāpatı desired, &lsquo;May I be more (than one), may I be reproduced&rsquo; He toiled, he practised austerity Being worn out with toil and austerity, be created first of all the Brahman, the triple science it became to him a foundation Resting on that foundation, he (again ) practised austerity He created the waters out of Vāk He desired, “May I be reproduced from these waters&rsquo; He entered the waters with that triple science Thence an egg arose He touched it “Let it exist, let it exist and multiply&rsquo;, so he said Now the embryo which was inside was created as agri &quot; And so the process continues with Agni Pfthvi etc
There are several variations of this basic theme, some features of the other cosmogonical trends, mentioned above, being integra ted with it Thus, for instance, according to SPBr XI 5 8, Prajāpati, who was alone in the beginning, desired, May I exist, may I be generated&rsquo;, practised penance, and eventually created the three worlds, namely, the earth, the antariksa, and the heaven He heated these three worlds, and from them, thus heated, respectively three lights were produced - Agni, Vayu, and Surya

From these lights were produced the three Vedas, and from these latter, thuh, Bhuvah, and svak And this legend is then set lato the framework of the discussion about a sacrificial procedure. Auf Br V.32 has a more or less similar legend, prajapatır akāmajata prajázeja bhujan sjām i1l/ sa tapo &lsquo;rapjata / sa tapas toptre &lsquo;măl lokān asrjata prtham antariksamt dram/ tål lokån abhy atapat, rebhyo &lsquo;bhitaptebhjes inni joriy ajāJanta etc. All this occurs in the context of the Agnihotra and the duties of the Brahman priest lo another version occurring in SPBT VOI 4 3, Prazpatı is said to have sought the help of the Pränas m having his desire to procreate fulfilled The Artarej a-Aranjaka I. I 8 speaks of the Purosa creatrag, by bus speech, etc, the earth with fire, etc
Sometimes, waters are represented as having preceded Praja pati (ŚPB. XI 161 ff) ipo ha vā idam agre sallam era &lsquo;sa tā akāmayonla kathar nu projájemahi &lsquo;11 / 1ā aframjams tās tapo lapjanta / tasu lapas tapjarānāsu hıranjam ändam sam babhūra. In a year&rsquo;s tude, a man, this Prajāpat, was produced therefrom. He broke opeo this golden egg There was then, indeed, do resting place, only this golden egg, bearing him, floated about for as loog as the space of a year At the end of a year he tried to speak. He said bhūh-this became the earth, he said bhurah this became antariksa, he said soh-this became the heaven We are then fortber told sa ( = prajāpatır) átmany era prajtim adhatla / sa asgerai &lsquo;sa deran asrjata atha jo &ldquo;Jam aran pränah / tena &lsquo;suran asrjata The Tautinija-Samhitā also has the legend of the waters and the cosmic egg
Besides a material principle, which is almost invariably the waters, abstract principles also are mentioned as the starting points of the creation process ID SPB, VI 1 1 1, asat us saxd to have been there in the beginning asad rá idam agre ist The question is then asked.

As for the number of lokas or worlds, the Brāhmana-texts are by no means unanimous While they generally speak of the tripartite universe consistiog of Prthivi, Antariksa, and Dyaus, they also contain other enumerations It, however, needs to be remembered that these different enumerations have very little or do cosmographical significance They are not intended to illumine the view of the Brāhmanas regarding the plan and structure of the universe, they are given mainly in order that they should conform to the ritualistic contexts in which they occur Thus, even the pormal tripartite universe is sometimes interpreted (TBr III

81, JB I 154) as being made up of Pitrloka, Deyaloka, and Manusyaloka. Sicularly, while explaining why there have to be two Yedis in the Sautrāmadī, the ŚPB(XII 7.3 7 ) says drau tāra lakar it) Zhur deralolos cai &rsquo;re pitrlokas ce According to the Attarej a-Arangala (II 4 1), there are four lokas, namely, arblas (which signifies the waters above the heaven), marici (lights or the Djaus), mara (the abode of the mortals that is, the earth), and åpah (waters under the earth) The mention of the earth as mara is specially poteworthy and would remind onc of what has been already said about the word ksam In connec tion with the Perusamedha, the SPBr (XIII 613 ) mentions the three lokas, namely, Prithivi, Antanksa, and Djaus, and the Duah, and adds erarod idam sarran (that is, presonably, the universe) Järad inte ca lokā disasca Reference has already been made to the sad utrih, the six wide opes, mentioned in that Brahmana Elsewhere that Brāhmana (XI 6 3 6) speaks of the universe as having been constituted of eight worlds, which are related to the cight Vasus, namely, Agni, Prthivi, Vāya, Antariksa, Aditya, Dyaus, Candramas, and Maksatrānu
But the references, which are particularly interesting from the point of view of the evolution of the Hindu cosmography, are those to the seven lokas For, it is these references, which, in a sense, may be said to mark the transition from the Vedic cosmography (which is generally influenced by the number &lsquo;three to the classical Paurānic cosmography (which clearly shows the influence of the number &lsquo;seven) The ŚPBr (LX 5 2. 8) speaks of the selen worlds of gods merely to make them correspood with a fitualistic detail, camely, the employment of the hymn of seven Ferses in connection with the puling up of the fire-altar saplarcam bharati/ saplacitko &lsquo;gnih sapta &lsquo;rtarah sapta disah sapla dera lokāk, etc. The Kausitakr-Brāhmana ( 20 1 ) is more specific. It narrates how the gods, molated on the wheel of the year, moved round the seven lokas, namely, the Deva-Petr-loka, the Agnu-loka or the Rtadhāma, the Vayu loka or ibe Aparajita (incidentally, it is sometimes suggested that Aparājita decotes the Dyuloka), the Indra-loka or the Adbıdıy, the Varuda-loka or the Pradiv, the

Mrtyu-loka or the Rocana, and the Brahmano Loka Altogether, this passage has an unmistakable Paurānic ring More note worthy, however, is the passage in the Tarttırıya-Arany aka (* 10 1 ) which speaks of the seven worlds, seven oceans, and seven mountains In another passage (X 27 28 ), it actually gives the names of the seven worlds, while in a third (1 7 1,3), it even mentions the Mahāmeru Incidentally, it may be pointed out that, in the context of the adding of fuel to the sacred fires, etc, the PBY (XI 6 8–10 ) alludes to sanasparīnam lokah, pašū. nām lokah, osadhinām lokal, and apăm lokah, which is reminiscent of the epic-Pauranic eschatology The significance of the plura. lity of lokas, from the point of view of the doctrine of salvation, seems to have been suggested in the Jaimnija-Brähmana (III 341 ff ) which tells us how Prajāpati created the gods, how he wanted to elude them, how, therefore, he went from one loka to another, how he stationed the various gods in those lokas, and how, finally, he united all those lokas into one, called nāka or Siarga or bradlımasya vistapa It becomes clear from this passage that the different lokas of the different gods are but partial aspects of the true heaven In this very context may be mentioned the commentary of the SPBT (VI 3 1 17) on the verse in the Vājasaneyr-Samhitā (115), senyantu visie amrlasja putrā , je dhāmānı divyāni tasthuh The amrla or the immortal one, verily, is Prajāpatı, his sons are all gods, and the heavenly abodes are these worlds
Speaking of the universe as a whole, the SPBT (XI11 22 13) says that it consists of sixteen parts (sodasokalam và idam sariom) As a matter of fact, this division into sixteen parts 15 applied also to man and the animal The lokas or the worlds are believed to have been founded on the waters and to have been linked with the sup by means of the quarters apsu hi &lsquo;me loka pratisthitah aditve hi me loka digblur ásakráh (SPB, VI 7 1 17) It has been further pointed out that the earth is stabilised by taeans of the mountains and rivers, the antarıksa by means of the birds and marici, and the heaven by means of the clouds and the stars (SPBr XI $ 1 2) Elsewhere the entire universe 15

The Kānra-SPBr (IV 5 2 13), botrever, says that there is pothing beyond Dyirāprthuvi.
A reference has already been made to the Vedic beuef that the heaven and the earth were ongially joined together The Brāhmanas also reiterate that belief The ŚPBT (1 41 22), indeed, says this of all the worlds.semantiham ira ha to me &lsquo;gre lokā ēsu if umsj a hat ira dicur asa &ldquo;lo the beginning, these worlds were well-nigh coauguons to one another, at that time one could touch the heaven thas” But, more specifically about the heaven and the earth, that Brõhmara (VII 1 223) says: saka har &rsquo;re rich agre lolar asatah, but, in the course of the crea t100-process djäräsrthri anant the heaven and the earth went asunder (SPB, VUI 4 316) Acd, when they parted asunder, the space, which was between them, became the antariksa saha hat &rsquo;re &lsquo;mör agre lokas äsatus (ajor rijator jo &lsquo;riarenā &ldquo;läsa änt tad Antarik som obharat (SPBr, VI 1.223) The Autareje-Brālmana (IV 27 ) adds that, after the separation of the beased and the earth from each other, there was neither ram por sunshine. The fie peoples ( panca janah) fell apart. But, eventually, the gods brought about general reconciliation through the mamae of Dyaus and Prthivi The Tailtrija-Brähmara (1 1 3 2), how crer, has a different, and a more ntual-oriented, Version It says The bearen and the earth frere originally close together On belog separated they said to each other, “Let there be a common 52crifiqat essecce (gjim) for us &quot; What sacrificial essere There was belonging to the yonder world, that is the beaven, that it bestowed on this earth, that became the salty grounds (on the earth) And what sacrificial essence there was belonging to this eartb, that it bestowed on the sonder world, that became the black spots in the moon Honcret, perhaps more zlominating ihan the above-quoted references to the wutual relationship between the heaven and the earth is the Brahmano-passage, which characterises the two worlds as retahsicau, seed-shedders.

As for the shape of Dyaus and Ppthivi, they are said to be round parimandalau hī &lsquo;mau lokau (ŚPBr VI 7 1 26) Elsewhese (SPB VII 51 iff ), the universe is compared to a Tortoise ( sa csa (Lūrmah) ima eja lokah) The lower shell of it (adharam hapălam) is this terrestrial world, and the upper shell of it is the yonder heaven For, the yonder heaven has its ends, as it were, bent down (varagrhītāntā djauh) And what is between the shells is antariksa The cosmographical signifi cance of this passage is unmistakable The Brāhmanas also speak of the heaven and the earth as having been properly fitted into each other (cf ŠPB, VIII 7 1 6)
In the Brālimanas, Dyaus is clearly distinguished from Svarga Broadly speaking, the concept of Svarga is eschatologi cal, while that of Dyaus remains essentially cosmogonical-cosmo graphical Svarga is invariably regarded as the ultimate goal of the sacrificial ritual (siargakamah jajeta) It would also seem that, as a cosmographical region, Svarga was roughly identified with nāka (ŠPBVIII S 34), which was described as dnah Irtiyam rocanam prstham the third luminous back of the heaven ( SPBr VIII 63 19) In the lausītakı-Brāhmana (21 4, 26 17), Dyaus is said to be the symbol - the visible symbol - of Svarga I may, however, add that, in the foregoing discussion about the Brāhmana-view of the upiverse, I have always rendered the word dj aus by heaven&rsquo; As a matter of fact, I have concen trated on Dyaus more or less ignoring Svarga
The Brälmanas have something interesting to say about the origin of Dyaus with a desire to multiply, Prapatı, by means of Vāyu, entered into union with Antariksa, thence an 488 arosc

From it, yonder Aditya was created. And the juice which was adhering to the shell became the sunbeams (rasnayah), and that which was the shell became Dydus Similarly, out of the union betreed Ādiga and Dyaus sere produced the moon, the inter med.ate quarters, and the chief quarters ($PBT VI 1 2.3-4) Elsen bere Br VI 525), Adityas are said to have fashioned Dyans Dyaus is golden harını a dyguh (SPB, XIV 1.3 29) The close connection betreen Dyaus and waters is suggested in various ways Dyzus is described as the seat of waters (apām sadanan, ŚPBr VII 5 2 56) or waters are some times even identified with Dyaus ( õpo roi djauh, SPB, VI 419) Commenting on the Vajasare, i-Samhita (23 53 ), the SPB, characterises Djaus as pūrvacsit or the first conception. An loteresting passage in the Parcarimsa-Brähmana (20 16 7) seems to suggest the superionty of Prthuvi to Dsaus, for, as it points out, the cattle do not procreate 10 the sonder world. One is here reminded of the lies that the earth is ever the bestower of new life, while the heaven is unfruitful - merely a brilliant culmination
The Brahmanas seem to suggest that the earth was ongoally jo a fard state, and that, eveptually, it was solidified through some kind of coagulatory process. The Adivarāha or the cosmo goric boar is said to have agitated the pameval waters and to have brought up some mod from the bottom of those waters It was this mud which became the beginning of the earth (USI 6 3) The Adivarāba is obviously to be identibed with Prajāpap, and presumably also with the sükara mentioned in the Atharyn eda (II 27 2, Y 14 1), and the vară: of the Aresta The Taittira. Brahmana (I. 1 3 5-6) presents a slightly different rersion of the myth. According to it, nothing was to be seen in the begionlag except water and a fotos-leaf stapdıog out above it Prabpan (being beot on creating the firm ground) bethought binsell that the lotus-stalk must be restrog on something, and, har mg assumed the form of a boar, he drved and brought up some of the mud This he spread out (prach) on the lotus leaf, whence ongidated the earth (prthii) The ŠPBr. (XIV 1 2 II) points

out that the earth was, in the beginning, of the size of a span (prādešamāırī), that a boar called Emūsa raised her up, and that this boar was her lord Prajāpati The Arrareja-Brāhmana says that the earth is round and supportless, but the SPBr (VI 1 2.29) speals of her being caluh-sraltı (four-cornered) and higher than the waters (ajam vai lolah adbhy ah utarah, XIV 3 1 28) This latter Brālmana also speaks (III 5 1 31 ) of this earth and the other two beyond it (imām, dhe asjäh pare). Finally, from the ritualistic point of view, Prthivi is characterised as one syllable of Gāyatri (SPBF VI 5 1 12) and as the great vessel ( mohad alapanam, SPB, XII 2 6 13 )
All these cosmogonical cosmographical details from the Brahmana texts must, however, be regarded as being, 10 a sense, but minor and incidental For, the most fundamental concept of the Brāhmadic cosmogony is that of the essed 131 bond between sacrifice and the world-process A reference has already been made to the pan-asuism of the Veda As a part of this pan-asuistic ideology, the Vedic poet-priests be lieved that the essential magic potence inhering withio &amp; person or a thiog could be either augmented or diminished or transferred from one person or thing to another person or thing by means of the magically potent mantras and practices - in other words, by means of the sacrificial ritual The true significance of the magical practices of the Athana eda and the ritual practices of the Brahnanas, indeed, rests on this belief from the point of view of the subject with which we are now concerned, namely, the universe in Vedic thought, it may be pointed out that the magical potence, asu, in the universe dwindles, on account of onc reason or another (Prappati&rsquo;s creative or procreative functions are said to have drained bus poners), and that, as a result of this, the entire cosmic process is seriously jeopardized Uoder such circumstances the magical potence in the universe is augmented by means of the sacrificial ritual, and the cosmic process is thereby revived For instance, on the basis of a critical analysis of the Rājasūya, it has been shown that that sacrifice was an 20

It was an abridged representation of the upcoding cyclical process of decay and regeneration The Vedic rtualists claimed that whateret was symbolically performed in a secrifice actually happened in the world-process Sacrifice can be aptly compared to a clockwork huch had to be lered up in order that the world should be kept goig
Another important doctrine, which developed out of this philosophy of sacrifice, has that of the close corresponderce between macrocosm and microcosm It », indeed, on the bas13 of this doctrine that the Brühm.ing-authors set many of their important ideas into the framework of the five &ldquo;correspondency (poccasu adhikaronesu)

However, attention needs to be drawn to a few siguificant points in this conpection Firstly, the earth itself seems to have been regarded as the last resting place of man At the time of the interment of the bones of the dead man, he is asked to &ldquo;crouch towards this mother earth, the spacious and friendly earth&rdquo;, for, the young lady. soft as wool to the gler of dok sınā&rdquo;, will &ldquo;guard you against the lap of nursi&rdquo; (upa sarpa mātaram bhūmım etām urujacasain prihnim suścıām / ürnamradā swatir dal sināiara esa na pätu nirrtor upasthät // RVX 18 10) Prthivi, on her part, is implored to vault up (ucchiañcasra) and Dot to press him in (mā ni bādhathāh, RV X 18 11 ) The mrnmaja grha, mentioned in RV VII 89 1, seems to refer to a vault under the earth where the dead person is interred Onc may see in these references a cosmographical region having been somebow related to the post mortem condition of man The notions that the various constituents of the universe bave origina ted from the different limbs of the cosmic Purusa,&rsquo; that there exists a close correspondence between the macrocosm and the microcosm, and that, therefore, the different limbs of a person go back after his death to the corresponding constituents of the universe, seem to form the ideological basis of such passages as RV X 16 3 Sūry ani cal sur facchafu tam imā djam ca gaccha prthuim ca dharmanā It must be added that the word dharmonā, in this context, has to be understood in the sense of * 10 accordance with the natural correspondence and not of in accordance with the religious merit&rdquo;
The Rgedic poets do speak of a land (or lands) of felicity where the god devoted people are described to be enjoying them selves (for instance, jatri naro dovajanto jugāni vitaniate prati bhadrāja bhadram, RVI 115 2, or naro jatra derajalo madanti, RV I 154 5) but they do so not necessarily in any eschatologal contexts Nor do they identify those lands with any cosmogra. phical regions A direct juxtaposition of the concept of the

world presided over by a particular god (which, however, is not sought to be identified with any cosmographical region) and the eschatological speculation is to be found 11 such passages as RV X 14 8 RVX 14 8 reads sam gacchasra pitrbhih sam jamene &lsquo;stapürfena parame ry oman/ hinajā &lsquo;radjam punar astam ehi sam gacchana tanya surarcáh (I would read surarcasă for suarcah) A critical study of this stanza would bring out the following signifi cant pouts After death, a person goes to the world of Yama. This world of Yama (jamaloka ) is also the world where the Pitars live (pitrblih jamena sam gacchana) In other words, the Jamaloka is identical with the putrloka 6 It is located to the lughest heaven (parame ronan) A person attajas to this world only as the result of his istápūria-of his acts of piety and chanty
This world is, deed, mao&rsquo;s opin natural home ( asta) Before Teacbing there, a person leaves behind all that was reprehensible in him (aradjam hināja), and assumes a new resplendent form (surarcasa tanrā) it may be pointed out that this Rgvedic passage corresponds almost fully with AVVI 120 3, which reads zatrā suhārdah sukrio madanı vaja rogam tanrah srāyāh/ alonā angair ahrutah srarge tatra pašjema pitarau ca putrān. The most noteworthy difference between the tno passages, how ever, is that instead of the pantaloka implied in the Rgedic passage the Atharvavedic passage uaequnocally speaks of srarga The points of correspondence between the two passages are (RV) pitrbhih sam gacciasta (AV) pitarau ca putron pajjema, (RV) istāpūrtena (AV) sukrtah, (RY) arad, am hitrāja (AV) nājah tanah rogam rihaja and (RI) Surarcesā lanrā (AV) aslonah angazh ahrutah Incidentally it may be added here that, in another significant passage in the Rgreda

The Atharvaveda refers to sarga fairly frequently - and thus, in most cases, 10 aa eschatological sense Starga is often men tioned as a place of blissful existence (etās na dhārā upe yantu sarvah svarge loke madhumat pinvamānāh, upa nā tisthantu pus karınıh samantăh, AV IV 34 5, sjargā lokā amrtona visthāh, AV XVIII 4 4 Incidentally, in the only Rgvedic passage where the word svarga occurs, X 95 18, it is this very idea that 15 stressed), and as a place which one secures as a reward for one&rsquo;s meritorious deeds or for charity and sacrificial performance # But it is very rarely that svarga is cosmographically defined in very general terms, it is said to be located in the third vault of the heaven (trtiye nāke, AV XVIII 4 3 ) or on the heaven&rsquo;s ridge (näkasja prsthe, AV XVIII 4 4) or in the third heaven (trtiyam nākam, AV IX 5 1 )One thing, however, is often stressed, namely, the association of this land of bliss with light svar,19 Jyotis, Suci 12 Indeed, it is even suggested that, though the word svarga as such occurs in the Rgveda only once, the concept of sarga is sometimes alluded to in that Veda by such words as jyotis and svar 13 It is noteworthy that the Atharvaveda seems to be actually speaking of a plurality of svargas (svargāh lokäh, AV XVIII 4 4)-it mentions punyāh lokah on the earth, in the antariksa, and in the heaven, 14 verily immeasurable punjah lokah (aparımı

Allusions in the Rgteda to heu as such are almost ni, and the notion in respect of it is noticeably vague But the idea that the singers and evil-doers are condemned to suffer in some distaal abyss occurs pot infrequently In one Rgedic passage (IV 5 5), for instance, the sinful, crooked, and potruthful are said to have prepared for themselves a gabhira pada, a deep station pāpasah santo and assiya idam padam ajangrā gabhram Sayada, 10 bis commentary on the passage, understands the phrase, gabhira pada as denotuag some infernal region or hell, GELDNER translates gabhira pada with &lsquo;geheimaisvolles Wort&rsquo;,&quot;&rsquo; but Sāyana&rsquo;s inter pretation seems to be confirmed by the unprecation in IV 5 148 (anáyudhasa i asarā sacantām) where the word asat is used more or less as a synonym of nurrt, which latter word also means perdi trog It may be, incidentally, pointed out, in this coctext, that, according to Y NORMAN BROWN,&rdquo; asar is the term by which heu is denoted in the Rgreda Hell represents just the opposite of the well-ordered world bich latter is denoted by the word sat Thus, hell is regarded as being similar to the primordial chaos Obviously, this view cannot be regarded as being supported by

104 16) Another point of contrast between the two is that, while the former is a realm of light, the latter implies anārambhana tanas ( RV VII 104 3), “bottomless darkness&rdquo; (also cf må le drsant sūrjam uccarantami, RV VII 100 24) It is only in one solitary passage that the infernal region is described in cosmogra. phical terms In RI VII 104 11, Vasistha curses the person &lsquo;who seeks to harm him, that he sink down to the region lying beneath &ldquo;all the three earths ” (tisrah prihıvır adho asiu visāh) This is also perhaps the only clear Rgvedic reference to what may be called the underworld&rsquo;, the concept relating to which plays a prominent role in popular Hindu cosmography and eschatology

<p>A proper appreciation of the essential distinction between Vedism (which is more popularly known as Brahmanism) on the one hand and Hinduism on the other would ensure the right perspective in the study of ancient Indian religious thought Broadly speaking, the Brahmapic thought, which was, in a sense, exotic on the Indian soil, may be said to have developed - both 10 logical as well as chronological sequence - from the stage of the cosmic-heroic mythology and magic of the Vedic Samhitās, through the stage of the mechanical sacerdotalism of the Brahma nas, to the stage of the monistic idealism of the Upanisads Paradoxically enough this last stage, which, indeed, represented the very acme of Vedic speculations, also proved to be, from a certain point of view, the harbinger of the decline of Vedism as such On account of some of their peculiar characteristics, the Upanisadıc teachings, which were the result of the way of thought of the few, could not possibly become translated into the way of life of the many This state of things gave rise to three main tendencies, each tendency representing, in its own way, a signifi cant turning point in the cultural history of ancient India Firstly, systems of thought, like Buddhism and Jainism, which are generally regarded as heterodox because they do not accept the ultimate valıdity of the Veda but which can be actually traced back to an indigenous Indian origin in the form of a common pre-Vedic thought complex, were quick in taking advantage of the atmosphere of free thinking created by the Upanisads and of the religious vacuum which had been engendered at that time They carried their appeal to the masses with great vigour, and ultimately succeeded, to a large extent, in winning them over. This resulted in the rapid growth of those heterodox religions - particularly Buddhism - and the corresponding decline of Brahma. nism But Brahmanism, which had such a glorious past, could by

no means be expected to become altogether cxtinct under the pressure-hosocier strong-of the non-Brahmadıc movements. On the contrary, by way of a reaction agamst the growing popu. lanty of the con-Brahmanic thought, it made a last bid for regaining its lost prestige This was the second tendency, and it found its literary expression in the Vedic Sürras and the other ancillary Vedic literature called Vedāngas The third tendency steered a course intermediate between the anti-Brahmanism of the heterodox religions on the one hand and the revivalism of the promoters of the Sätra-Vedānga movement on the other
Esen from very early times, there had existed in India, side by side with the hieratic Vedic religion, several popular tribal religions The gods and goddesses of these tribal people were different from the divities of the official Vedic pantheon Their religious practices also differed fundamentally from the religious practices of the Vedic Arjaos. Indeed, these tribal religions were definitely noo-Vedic in provenance and character It is een possible to discover the beginnings in the ideology of the pre Vedic non-Aryan indigenous population of lodia. From this point of view at least, they were more akin to the heterodox systems of thought referred to abore But there has one point of essential differcoce between these fro These popolar tribal religions soon and under the spell of Vediso And, though they did not actually adopt the religious ideology and practices of Vedism in any appreciable measure, they followed the very pract cal acd realistic course of alowing allegiance to the Veda - hoxsoever gonnal and superficial that allegiance might have proved to be in actuality Naturally cough, while Brahmanism kad been so ascendancy, the sphere of midence of these popular religions was restricted to the respective tribes among whom thsy had originated.

could not be effectively met by mere revivalist efforts A common popular front wis required to be presented against them Conse quently, most of the popular religions, with their variety of gods and religious practices, came to be organized into one single but multi-charactered whole, which was held together by means of the thin thread of their allegiance to the Veda This is the genesis of Hinduism Hinduism, in its origin, was verily a parliament of religions, over which the Veda formally presided but whose normal functioning, like any other presiding authority in modern parliamentary systems, it does not seem to have noticeably influenced It may te pointed out that the third tendency, mentioned above, manifested itself in the form of Hinduism, which, while effectively arresting the growth of anti-Brahmanic thought, successfully combated the insularity and exclusiveness of Brahmanism by bringing together under its banner large masses of people and, at the same time, kept the Vedic tradition alive
One very significant constituent of this all inclusive Hinduism was Krsnaism This religion seems to have originated and spread among the tribes of Western and Central India, like the Vrsons, the Sātvatas, the Abhiras, and the Yādavas Its priocipal teacher was Kęsna who is seen to have been associated with the above mentioned tribes in one way or another 1 He was presumably the temporal head as well as the spiritual leader, and was, in course of time, transformed into a tribal god. That this tribal god and the religious movement inspired by him were originally not countenanced by the hieratic Vedic religion 18 jadicated by the episode of the Govardhana mountain, which portrays the chief Vedic God Indra&rsquo;s antagonism to and subsequent subjugation by Krsna This is clearly symbolical of the popular tribal religion having prevailed over the hieratic Brahmanıc religion But the religion of Krsna may generally be said to be typifying the paradoxical characteristic of Hinduism, mentioned above, namely,

a fundamental departure from Brahima is so far as its basic tedets are concerned coupled with a deliberate pon-aburation of loyalty to the Veda
The Bhagavadgita, which is by far the most well-known religio-pbulosophical text in Sanskrit, may be fooled upon as ad authoritate manual of Krsnate religion, philosophy, and ethics Wher, in the course of the growtå of the drahábhárara, the bardic historical poem, Jaja, was being transformed into the primary cpic, Bhārata, tiyo pripcipal processes had been in operation, zamely, the bandic ealargement of the original ballad-cycle relating to the Kuru Bharatas and the Krsmate redaction of the bardıc material Presumably the Bhagaradgita served as the corper-stone of this Krsparte superstructure It has, however, to be remembered that, though the Bhagaradgita originally epitomi sed the teachings of Krsna, after it had been included into the epic, it also was subjected to the final process of Brahmanic revision like the rest of the epic
The religion of Krsoa differed from the finally developed form of the Vedic ideology, firstly, in its teaching about the goal of hu man life The earlier Upanisads, which give the most consummate espression to the Vedic thought in this connection, have generally put forth the view that, since this phenomenal sorld and the honan existence, so far as this latter &gt; governed by the body-mind-com plex, are fundamentally unreal, man must renounce this worldly Life and aim at realising the ongoai esseotral identity of his soul with the Universal Self, which is the one and the only absolute reality It will be thus seca that the Upsosadis attitude is essentially indi Hidualistic and, to a large etteat, negatire The Bhagaradgilā, on the other hand, teaches that man&rsquo;s chief duty 15 the promotion of lokasamgralia, that is to say, of the stability, solidanty, and progress of the society The society can function properly only on the principle of the chal roterdependence of its ranoz constituents Man must, therefore, see to it that, as an essential

constituent of the society, he furthers this process of lokasamgraha through an active awareness of his social obligations The Bhagavadgită has thus invested its teaching with positive social values The svadharma or specific social obligations of different types of men are, according to the Bhagavadgita, best embodied 10 the doctrine of câturiarnja or the scheme of four social orders Though the adoption of this doctripe by the Bhagavadgitā may have been due, to a certain extent, to the Brahmanic influence, the way in which it has sponsored it is peculiarly its own Unlike the Brahmanic texts, the Bhagavadgitā pever refers to the superio rity of one social order to another It consistently emphasizes only the socio ethical sigoificance of that scheme All social orders are equal and essential from the socio-ethical point of view It&rsquo; would, 10deed, seem that the insistence of the Bhagavadgita was mainly on man&rsquo;s active recognition of his svadharma or social obligations, the cãtunarnya having been referred to-almost by way of an example-as a scheme, which, in the context of certain specific circumstances, best ensured the recognition by men of their respective svadharmas
The second fundamental point in which the Bhagavadgită differs from the Vedic thought follows logically from the first As indicated above, the Upadisadıc ideal of spiritual emancipation through self realisation presupposes the acceptance of the woreai character of the phenomenal world Through his actions, man gets entangled, consciously or unconsciously, in the tantaliziog affairs of this fictitious world and is thus removed farther and farther away from his goal A complete abnegation of action, therefore, came to be regarded almost as a sine que non of a true seeker&rsquo;s spiritual quest On the other hand, the ideal of lokasamgraha through the fulfilment of svadharma, enjoined by the Bhagavadgitā, necessarily implies an active way of life The Bhagavadgita, 10 deed, often Speaks in terms of joga (from the root yu=to apply oneself to ) rather than of moksa (from the desiderative of the root muc=to untie or to loose) The teacher of th eBhagavad

gira has discussed, at great length, the why and the how of this karmayoga Verily, that is the main therae of the poem. The activism sbuch the Bhagavadgită seeks to inculcate is, however, not of the common type It is certainly unique in that it is traged - perhaps, under the influence of the Upansadıc thought with some element of renunciation The Bhagavadgitā attempts to reconcile its ideal of lokasamgraha or social solidanty and progress with the Upanisadic ideal of rolsa or spiritual emanci pation of an individual It argues that action, as such, does not prore deinmental to one&rsquo;s anainment of his spinnual goal It is his attachment to the fruits of his actions that keeps him eternally unvolved in the cycle of births aod deaths The Bhagaradgita, therefore, teaches its Yoga or skulfal art of &ldquo;how to act without being involved in the consequences of action. It teaches the anasaktı-joga, that is, renunciation in action and not of action
The activism (kormaloga) of the Bhagavadgit must by DO means be confused with the way of work (1 armakanda) of the ntut Lustic texts If the way of renunciation, taught by the Upanisads, was inconsistent with the ideal of the Bhagavadgură, the way of work taught by the Brāhmanas and the Sūtras, buch was actually constituted of ritualistic practices and as a reaction against which the Upanısadıc doctrine of renonciation had erotred, was more so The elaborate and the highly complex system of sacrifice could never have become the religion of the people * Krsta, there fore, sponsored a pay of spiritual life in which everybody - Irespectne of caste, creed, and sex - could participate It was the way of bhaktı or desotion. The way of bhaktı presupposes the recognition of a personal god -10 the present context, of coprse, Krsna himself - who is regarded as being responsible for the creation, preservation, and destruction of the perse The dezotee senses that God like a loyal servant, always craving for some kind of personal comunion with Him.

richness or profuseness of the materials used for worsbup nor the number and variety of religious observances involved in it It 1$ rather the urge and the earnestness, the faith and the sense of complete surrender to the Divine, on the part of the devotee Such a bhahta - whatever his age, sex, learning, or social status indeed, compels God to become his friend, guide, and philosopher, The way of bhakti is thus more simple, more direct, and more effective than any other religious practice And the cultural history of India bears ample testimony to the fact that the cult of bhaklı has proved to be the only force, which could unite large and heterogeneous masses of people into one truly democratic religious brotherhood in his teaching of bhakti, however, Krsna has made one sigoificaat addition He has insisted that a true harmayogin, that is, one who adopts the activism as taught by the Bhagavadgita as his way of life, alone can become a true bhakra, for, by following his svadharma, the karmayogin is only promoting the will of God and is participating in the fulhiment of the divine project
It has already been pointed out that the Bhagavadgita could not altogether give up the Upanisadıc ideal of moksa It could not also altogether evade the ritualism of the Brālimanas While, therefore, coordinating it with its own thought-pattern the Bhagavadgitā stressed the spirit of the sacrificial ritual rather than its form It seems to have been suggested that, just as loka samgraha implies the ethical interdependence in the social sphere, sacrifice implies the ethical interdependence in the cosmic sphere
krsnaism cannot boast of any independent philosophical system of its own As a shrewd leader of the people, Kșşaa had realised that what the people wanted was not so much an abstract, metaphysical way of thought as a concrete, practical way of life He, therefore gave them a religion and a code of conduct The different schools of philosopby which were then prevailing, tended, on the one hand, to confound the people at large and, on the other, to encourage dogmatism among their respective

followers And dogmatism - whether religious or phulosophical - often tends to divide rather than to unite The Bhagaradgut, therefore, instead of dilating upon the points of difference among the various systems of thought and practice, emphasised the points of agreement among them and thereby brought about a positive philosophical and religions synthesis? And, it may be recalled, synthesis is the very watchword of Hipduism
It has been alreads suggested that at one stage, like the other parts of the Jahābhārala, the Bhagaralgitā also must have undergone a kind of Brahmanic reonentation - however artificial and superficial that reorientation might have been This 15, indeed, true of Hinduism as a whole One of the more significant results of tos reonentation, so far as the personality of Krsoa was concerned, was that that tribal god who was essentially non-Vedic in origin and who had already developed a composite personality, cute to be regarded as an atatāra ( cardation) of the All-god and also as being identical with the Upanısadıc brahman

<p>The subject of my talk1 has been appounced as &ldquo;The Beginnings of Vaišnavism &quot; What, however, I propose to do this evening is to make a few general observations on the early phases of Vaisnavism as reflected in Panini&rsquo;s Astādhyāyi and Patañjali&rsquo;s great commentary on it Without discussiog at any length the question of the dates of Panini and Patañjali, for my present purpose, I take Pāniji to have lived in the fifth century B C and Patañjalı about 150 B C I am aware of the view of some scholars that the Mahābhasya (MB) contains certain inter polations made at a much later date, but I do not find that view quite convincing
I shall begin with the assumption, which, I believe, will be readily acceptable to all, namely, that, when the Vedic Aryans arrived in India, there was by no means any kind of religious vacuum in this country Different religious cuits prevailed in different regions of the pre-Vedic non-Aryan India It is possible to identify at least two main such cults, which I would designate as the Muni-Yati-cult and the Bhakti cult in contradis tinction from the Vedic Aryan religious cult which I would characterise as the Rsi cult Broadly speaking, the Muni-Yati cult subsisted as a dominant feature of the Pasupati Sıva religion of the Indus valley as also of the ancient Magadhan religious complex which latter eventually proved to be the fountaid-head of Jainism and Buddhism among others. It may be presumed that the indigenous Muni-Yatı and Bhakti-cults and the exotic Rsi cult exercised significant influence upon one another, both 10 a positive and a negative sense For instance, the Vedic god Rudra is but a Vedic Aryan ver5100 of the pre-Vedic non-Aryan

Siya, both in name and character On the other hand, there are clear indications in the Rgreda of the Vedic Arad antagonism towards the Yatıs, the spades3s, and the Mūradevast It is again pot improbable that Vasistba&rsquo;s attitude towards Varuna was influenced by the indigenous Bhakti-cult It would seem that, on account of its freshness, vigour, and flush of victory, the Vedic Arjan religion oser shelmed the various indigenous religions cults and kept them under suppression for a fairly long time Wyben, however, the hold of that religion upon the people at large began to dwindle owing to various obvious reasons in the last days of the major Upanısads, that is, in the seventh-sixth centuries B.C, the indigenous religious cults again came into their own and soon developed into potent religious forces to such an extent that they eventually came to pose a serious challenge to the Vedic religion itself
The doctrine of Bhakts may be said to constitute perhaps the most significant feature of what we today understand by Vaisna. Vism And one of the correlates of Bhakti is the concept of a sis, that is, special benediction or grace of god In P (Panipi-Süira) VI 2 148, kārakad dallašrutas or enā &lsquo;$131, there occurs an indica tion of such benediction or grace Speaking about the accent, this Sutra tells us that, in respect of a nume, huch implies benediction, such as Devadatta ( which is explained as dera enom dejāsuh), the posterior member of the compound being a past passive participle, gets the Udátta accent on its last syllable, only 1 that past passive participle 15 either dorta or fruta. It is suggested that a similar kind of benediction or grace is intended also in P V 3 847
More pertinent to our present purpose, however, is the group of Sutras, P IV 3 95-99 P IV 395 is made up of one single

word, namely, bhaktıh But, in this context, the word bhakti is used in a variety of senses, such as, &lsquo;attachment&rsquo;, &lsquo;liking&rsquo;, &lsquo;loyalty&rsquo;, and religious devotion&rsquo; It may also be noted that, here, commentators understand the word bhah in the sense of object of bhakır&rsquo; (bhaktivisaja) The Sutras mention different termipa tions to be affixed to different words while forming from those words derivatives meaning persons who entertain bhakt for the entities (things, persons, etc ) denoted by those words For instance, according to P IV 395, as explained by commentators, the termination an is used in the case of persons entertaining bhaktı or attachment for a certain locality Thus a person, the ob ject of whose bhak 11 or attachment is Srughna, is called Sraughna In the case of a person who entertains bhahti or liking for a thing, which is insentient and which denotes something other than space or time, the termination is thak 9 Accordingly, one, the object of whose liking is apūpa, is called apūpika 10 The termination than is used to derive a word meaning one who entertaios bhaktı for Mahārāja - P IV 3 97 mahārājāt than 11 The exact sense of the word mahārāja in this Sūtra is not clear It is suggested that mahārāja may here denote Kuberall or a Lokapāla in general10 Or, otherwise, on the strength of P IV 2 35 - mahārājaprostha. padát than - mahārāja is understood as some kind of divinity? It, is however, not improbable that, 19 P IV 3 97, the word, mahārāja, is used in a political sense and that bhakti, in that case, denotes loyalty
It may be noted that the meaning of the word bhakti ID connection with the three Sūtras - P IV 3 95-97 - discussed above (namely &lsquo;attachment&rsquo;, &lsquo;luking, loyalty&rdquo;) are more or less secular in character The Sūtra in this group, which is most crucial for our present purpose, is P IV 3 98 1āsuderarju

tion, as is generally the case with Patañjalı, is more pertinent Patañjal points out - and here we can do no better than depend on Patanjalı - that Vásudeva mentioned by Panini 10 IV 3 98 cannot be said to have been covered by IV 3 99 For, Vasudeva of P IV 3 98 18 not the name of any ordinary Ksatriya, but it is the name of the worshipful one &ldquo;I7 In other words, vāsudera of P IV 3 98 signifies the god Vásudeva as against any ordinary Ksatriya, named Väsudeva, who may be covered by the word ksatriya in P IV 3 99 Thus, according to Pánını, the word for the Bhakta of Vasudeva, the god, is to be derived by affixing the termination nun, while that for the Bhakta of Vasudeva, any ordinary Ksatriya, is to be derived by affixing the termination vun-though, eventually, the form and the accent of the so derived words may be the same 18
It may be pointed out that some editions of the MB read samiñar &lsquo;sā tatrabhagavatah for samjña&rsquo;sa tatrabhavatah The intention of P IV 3 98, namely, that asudeva mentioned in the Sutra is the name of a god is thereby made quite explicit Kaiyata also seems to accept that reading, for, his gloss reads nityah paramātmavisesa iha vasudevo gihjate It would, however, seem that tatrabhagavatah was a deliberate emendation of tatrabhavatah The critical edition of the MB by KIELHORNIP leaves no doubt about this Moreover, the occurrence of tatra in tatrabhagavatah is rathar strange It is also to be remembered that in most cases where the word bhagavat occurs in the MB, it refers to Pānını 20
That the word tatrabhavat, in this context, implies divinity can be safely presumed 21 It is used in opposition to the word ksa triya, tatrabharat here denotes one who is different from a Kșa triya He (that is, tatrabhajan) may be a &lsquo;worshipful&rsquo; Ksatriya

Qon-bonjo&rsquo; or * divde&rsquo; and human&rsquo; P IV 399, which men trous ksatriya without suggesting any distiaction between or dinary&rsquo; and Worshipful&rsquo;, rales out the first alternative It may also be noted, up this connection that Patanjal uses the word tatra bharat without any substantie The second alternative also 13 verdered nugatory in view of the fact that Patañjali hardly ever croplays the word räsudera as the tage of a person belonging to a social order other than Ksatrya* We have therefore to assume that ratrabhavan Väsudeva (mentioned in P IV 3 98) 13 a god and is to be distinguished from a Ksatnya whose name night be Vasudeva and who could then be covered by P IV 3 99 It may be, tacidentally, added that Vasudeva, when coupled with Arjuna, usually denotes a god
It is, howeser, not intended to be suggested that wherever the word tatrabharat occurs in the Bit refers to a god The word occurs fourteen times in the VB In all these contexts, except three, the substantives qualified by farrabhasat are specifi cally mentioned in the three passages, which represent the exception, tatrabharat is not followed by any substantive, that is to say, it is itself used in the sense of a substantive Two of these three passages, namely, commentanes on Þ IV 2 25 and P IV 3 98, read samjhau &lsquo;sā tatrabhadiah P IV 2 25 kasyer-explains, among other thogs, the form haya in the sense of something whose diyzpty is Ka or Prapata2 The question is there posed regarding the call which the Adbvaryn is required to give out in coppection with the Puronovākya relating to the offering to Ka (kājam harih) should it be

kasmai anubrühi (on the assumption that hāyam presupposes the adesa to kım) or kaja anubrīlu ( on the assumption that ka is an independent word)? Pataõjalconcludes that, in either case, the call should be hasmai anubrüh with the pronominal dative hasmai) for, he argues with rather queer logic, both him and ka are saryanāmas-him because it is a pronoun, and ha because it is the nama (name) of sarra (that is, Prajāpatı) Continuing, Patanjali alludes to another view on the subject and ends with the statement, samjñā cai &lsquo;sā tatrabharatah What is relevant to our present purpose is that the word tatrabhavat ( used by itself) in this statement clearly denotes a god, that is, Prajāpati The context permits no doubt about this whatsoever One would, therefore, be fully justified in inferring that, in an exactly similar statement in the commentary on P IV 3 98 also,24 the word tatrabha at denotes a god This would then support our earlier contention that vasudeva in P IV 3 98 is the game of a god The godhead of Vasudeva and Vasudevison or the religion centering round Vasudeva (which has to be regarded as the primary form of the classical Vaisnavism ) must have become fairly well established in Pānini&rsquo;s time (5th century BC) indeed, so much so that Panini thought it necessary to compose a special Sūtra 18 respect of them
It may be presumed that the popular religion with its cult of Bhakti, which had been reduced to a kind of torpidity on account of the increasingly pervasive influence of the Vedic Aryan religion, became re-animated, as it were, as the vitality of the Vedic religion began to diminish, and an aspect of it emerged in the form of Vāsudeyism and, as we have seen, became a dominant force already in Panini&rsquo;s time the tradition of the supreme godhead of Vasudeva and of Vasudevism has been continuous ever since that time Megasthenes (4th century B C ) speaks of the people of Sūrasena who held Heracles (by whom Megasthenes obviously meant Vasudeva-Krsna ) in special veocration 28 The

Bhagavadgitá (3rd century BC) eulogises the man of know ledge, who, at the end of several births, betakes himself unto the Lord in the conviction &quot; Vasudeva is All&rdquo; (VII 19) We then have the Bespagar inscription, belonging to the last quarter of the second century BC, on the Garudadhvaja of Vasudeva, the god of gods, erected by Heliodoros, the Bhagavata, the son of Dion and an whabitant of Taksasila
We have seen that Patañjalı has characterised Vásudeva of P IV 3 98 as tatrabhavar and has thereby isolated him from any Ksatriya whose name may be Vasudeva But there is a well Attested tradition that the god Vasudeva himself origioally belonged to the Ksatriya family of the Vrsnis in this context, one may just remind oneself of the Lords statement in the Bhagavadgitā, gamely * Of the Vrsais, I am Vasudeva &quot; (X 37) This tradition is confirmed also by the MB Commenting on the seventh Vārttika24 of P IV I 114,27 Patañjalı relates Vasudeva to the Vrsni family orsayano &lsquo;lakásah vasudevah bāladevah That, bere, the divide Vasudeva is intended becomes clear from his association with Baladeva 2 Sankarsana was a well-known Vrsni prince (who too was deified), and inscriptions closely ally Vasudevi with him thereby implying that Vasudeva also was a Vrsni prince who was later deified 29 Thus the Ghosundi stone Lascription of king Sarvatata, belonging to the second half of the first century BC, weations the construction of a stone eaclosure, called Nārāyana-vátaka, for the place of worship of the gods Samkarsana and Väsudeva Similarly, homage is paid to Samkarsada and Väsudeva in the Nanaghat cave inscription of the Sātavāhana queen Nāgapikā of the first century BC The Kasıkā emphasises this close relationship between Samkarsana 20d Vasudeva by giving the example, dvandvam sankarsana vasudevau, to illustrate the first Vārttıka of P VIII 1 15, namely,

atjantasahacarite lolajñāte diandam iry upasamh hjänam From all this, coupled with P IV 3 98 as explained above, onc may, Indeed, presume that Vasudeva of the Vrsais had been deified and made into the supreme god of Vasudevism already before Pánını&rsquo;s time
Incidentally, a reference may be made in this contert to the fact that there had been several Ksatriya princes who bore the name Vasudeva, but that it was only the Vrai prince Vasudeva who was derfied and became the supreme god of Vasudevism Traditional legends are narrated of Vasudeva, king of Pundralas, and Väsudeva, ling of Karavirapura, each of whom claimed to be the true divine Vasudeva but whose claim was entirely nullified by the powers of Vasudeva Krsna of the Vrsnis 30
Though the religion centering round the popular god Visu deva had become well established since before Panini&rsquo;s time, it 15 strange that the Buddlust canonical text Amguttaranılāja, which mentionsal such religious sects as the Ājivikas, the Nirgranthas, the Mundasrāvakas, etc, does not refer to the Vasudevalas Similarly, Aloka&rsquo;s inscriptions, which mention the Sramanas, the Brāhmanas, the Ājivikas, and the Nirgraothas, do not speak of the Väsudevalas The only possible explanation of this would be that Vasudevism, which was naturally restricted to the regions dominated by its chief promoters, namely, the Vrsors, the Sátvatas, and the Yadavas-Ābhiras, had not till then spread far towards Eastern India which was the provenance of Buddhism On the other hand, it was well known to Pánını of Taksasia as also to Megasthenes, and it is also seen to have attracted, 10 course of time, even foreigners like Heliodoros It may be further noted that the Middesa works (1st century BC), which,

though of the nature of commentaries, share the authority of the Pali canon, allode to various religious sects among which are Jocluded the worshippers of Vasudeva and Baladeva So far as Jainism is concerned, it seems to have been more positively responsive to Väsudeyism The Vasudeva-legends have markedly influenced the Jaina hagiology, particularly its concept of risasti dalakāpurusay wbo comprise, among others, Dipe Vasudevas, AC Baladevas, and gine Prativasudevas
Another striking fact regarding the Vasudeva religion is that the word vasudevcha, in the sense of a Bhakta of Văspdeva, 15 aot attested to any available literary work. On the other hand, since a descriptre grammarjao like Panini has devoted a separate Sutra to the morphological erplanation of that word, it must have been very much in vogue in his time we are, therefore, constrained to assume that considerable iterature of non-Vedic characters existed in Pangi s tinde bat that it is now lost to us 2 Attention tray be drawn to still another point which is important for the history of Vaisnatic Punini impliedly speaks of a religious sect the main feature of which was bhaku of Vasudeva On the other hand, he does pot allade to Vaisdavin either directly or indirectly It would, therefore, seems that the basic clement of what has now come to be known as VarnaVIS I was the Vasudeva religion, In other words, the starting point of what we today understand by Vasnavism was not Visnu but Vasudeva The term vasudevala must, accordingly, be regarded as having been much older than the terra vaisnava.
P IV.3 98 implies that, besides the Vasudeva-religion, there also existed, in Paninis time, a religious sect centering round Arjuna. The word for the Bhakta of Arjuna the god was, according to P.IV 3 98, to be derived by affixing the terming tion run to the word arruna - it was arrunaka, the word for the

Bhakta of a Ksatriya called Arjuna was, on the other hand, to be derived by affixing the termination vun (P IV 399)- it was orjunaka However, unlike the Vāsudeya religion, the religious history of India knows hardly anything of the Arjuna-religion It is suggested that the Arjunāyanas mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar inscription of Samudra Gupta were the followers of the Arjuna-cult 35 This cannot be accepted For one thing, if they were really the devotees of the divine Arjuna, according to P IV 3 98, they should have been called Arjunakas and not Arjunāyanas Secondly, the context in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription makes it quite clear that the Arjunāyapas are repre sented there essentially as a socio-political entity rather than a religious one It is more likely that the tribe of the Arjunāyanas was so called because it claimed descent from the Pandava hero Arjuna 36 The grammatical form of the word arjunājana would also confirm this 37 Another suggestion is that P IV, 3 98 does not presuppose two independent religious sects - one of the Vásu. devakas and the other of the Arjunakas - but that the Sūtra refers to one single religious sect with Vasudeva as the supreme god and Arjuna as the special devotee Obviously, this suggestion runs counter to the essential trend of that Sutra
We have to acquiesce in the fact that, in Panini&rsquo;s time, there did prevail two independent religious cults, namely, the Vāsudeva cult and the Arjuna cuft Further, from the manner in which they have been referred to by Pānını, it may be assumed that these two cults were closely allied to each other - the Vásu deva-cult having been regarded, even at that time, as being superior to the Arjuna-cult 38 Io the Rgvedic mythology, Vişğu is closely associated with Indra 3) According to Satapatha

Brahmana II 1 2 11 and V 4 3 7, Arjuna is a secret or mystical (guhya) dame of lodra, while, in later Vaistavism, the persona lity and character of Vedic Visou have been merged into those of Vasudeva. Therefore, the alliance between the two independent religious cults, namely, the Vasudeva cult and the Arjuna-cult, with which Pānını seems to have been familiar, may be sad to correspond, in a way, with the alliance between the two indepen dent divities of the Rgvedic mythology, namely, Visou and Indra. Another prototype of such an allunce betiveer two independent religious cults is to be seen in the religious ideology pertaining to Nara and Nārāyana, 4 wherein Nara may be regarded as the alter ego of Indra ( of the Rgveda ) and Arjuna (of P IV 3 98) and Nārāyana of Vuou ( of the Rgveda) and Vasudeva (of P IV 398) It would seem that, out of the two religious cults respectively centering round Vasudeva and Arjuna, the Vasudeva-cult, which was already regarded as the more dominant cult, soon subdued and submerged within itself the Arjuda-cult That is why we do not find any traces of thus latter cult either 10 history or in literature
The classical Vaspavism, with which one is generally familiar, is a kind of amalgam principally of four, ongipally independent, religious elements respectively embodied 20 the personalities of the four divinities, namely, Vasudeva, Krsna, Visau, and Nārāyana The identification of Krsos with Vasudeva, which constituted perhaps the most vital stage in this process of amalga mation, seems to have already been an accomplished fact - Indeed, of long standing - in Patañjali&rsquo;s time The two names, Vasudeva and Krsna, occur in the MB almost as synonyms For instance, while Vasudeva is said to have kiled Kins1, jaghang kamsam kıla vasudevah ( commentary on P III 2 111), Kroa is represented as having a grudge against his maternal unde

(Kamsa ) - asādhur mātule krsnah (commentary, some editions, on Vārttika 2 of P II 3 36) More convincing still is Patasijali&rsquo;s commentary on Vārttika 15 of P III i 26, where the words krşng and 1āsudeva occur in the same context as the names of one and the same divide being cifresu katham/ citresy apy udgūrni nipattaś ca prahārā dršjante hamsasya ca krsnasya ca/ kecil kamsabhaltā bhavantı kecid sāsudevabhak täh &rsquo;s Reference bas already been made to the close association of Vasudeva and Samkarsana as evidenced both by literature and inscriptions While commenting on Värttika 22 of P IT 2 24, Patadjali quotes, by way of illustration, a verse-half wherein Samkarsana is repre sented as being associated with Krsna in exactly the same manner: samkarsanadvilisasja balam krsnasya vardhatām
As regards the relationship between Vasudeva and Krsna, the view is sometimes put forth that Kisna was the original god, that Krşna and Vasudeva were not separate divide entities, and that Vāsudeva was just the patronymp of Kțşna derived from bis father&rsquo;s name Vasudeva Several objections can be raised against this view Firstly, the commentary on Värttika 7 of P IV 1 114 indicates that Vasudeva, and not Vasudeva,4* is the basic (underived) form of the name and that the termination an affixed to this original Dame Vasudeva also gives the forma asudeva Secondly, if Vasudeva was really a patronym, Baladeva or Sam karsana, who is represented as the elder brother of Krsna, should have been more aptly called Vasudeva But that is hardly ever the case On the other hand, we find Krsna and Baladeva being specifically referred to by their matronyms, namely, Devakiputra and Raubineya respectively The rivalry among some Ksatriya princes for the real divine * Võsudevahood,&rdquo; to which a reference has been made above, also clearly goes against Vasudeva being regarded as a patronym JACOBI has drawn attention to the following etymology of the word vasudeva given in the Mahā.

The main course of cvents, which eventually culminated 10 the identification of Vasudeva and Krso seems to have been something like this The religious ideology, with bhakti of Vasu deva – the Vrsar prioce who had come to be regarded as a god - as its central theme, must have arisen at a fairly early time so as to become thoroughly well established in the days of Pānın (5th Century BC) Perbaps a Jitle later than Vasudevism, another religious sect grety round the figure of Krsoa, who had ongoally been the tribal hero and religious leader of the Yādavas Thuis Yadava Krsna may as well have been the same as Devakīputra Krsna who is represented, in the Chandogja-Upanisad III 17 1, as a popul of Ghora Angirasa 54 and who is said to have learnt from his teacher the doctrice that man&rsquo;s life is a kind of sacrifice The chronological evidence does cot go against such assumption, if at all, it supports at Be that as it may, Krsoa must be said to have developed his own special philosophy of ufe, the main tenets of which were lokasamgraha and renunciation in action rather than of action 51 When, in course of time, the -Yrsnis and the

Yādavas, who were already related to each other, came closer together, presumably for political reasons, the personalities of Vrsai Vasudeva and Yadava Krsna were merged into each other so as to give rise to the new supreme god, Bhagavan Vāsudeva. Kęsna This must have happened not long after Panini&rsquo;s time In the nety legends, Väsudeva came to be interpreted as the patronym of Krsna Some Vasudeva came to be regarded as Krsna&rsquo;s fathers and the Vrsni Samkarsana-Baladeva as his elder brother in course of time, a third religious ideology, namely, the one which centered round Gopāla Krsna and which was presumably sponsored by the pastoral Abhiras, came to be engrafted on the organically combined Vásudeva-Krsna religion The teachings of Bhagavān Vāsudeva-Krsna were soon consolida ted and embodied in a popular religio philosophical text This text was later interpolated, obviously after suitable modifications, into the bardic-historical poem, Jaya, in the form of the Bhagavad gitã, whereby it served as the coraerstone of the superstructure which transformed the Jaya into the Bharata 53
In Patanjali&rsquo;s time, Vasudeva ( or rather Vasudeva-Krsna) had already become a religio legendary figure He had come to be regarded as having belonged to a remote past P. III 2 111 - anadyatane lan - explains the use of the imperfect tense The

Second Varttika of that Sutra - parolse ca lolchijfāte prafoktur darśar.Avisoje - prescribes that, with reference to a well-known erent which has happened out of one&rsquo;s sight but which one could have seen, one should use the operfect tense (lan) and not the perfect (Int) Here, Patialgses the etample, crwad jararah säletam 54 The historically sell-LQOWD siege of Saketa by the Yavana as a contemporaneous event in Patanjali&rsquo;s time Though a person belongiog to that period may not have actually seed it, in view of its contemporaneity, he could have witnessed st. Therefore he uses the imperfect tense form, crurat As a counter-example, Patanjali mention Joghāra homsor kila rasy derah. The Killing of Kamsa by Vásudeva was an event which was parokso that is, su buch had bappened out of one s sight) and lokarijrata (traditionally well-known ), but which was proroktuh adarsanarisara (that is, bich was so accept that it was not and could not have been seen by the speaker) Therefore, with reference to that event, the speaker had to use the perfect tense and not the imperfect tense Thas, uo Patzāli&rsquo;s time, the killing of Kamsa by Vasudeva had already become a houry or legendary event, an event of the remote past.
Further evidence to this connection is provided by Patzõpu&rsquo;s commentary on P III 126 - Fetman ca - 20d its Vārtikas I be subject discussed therein is the use of the causal Vārtika 6 of that Sutra, namely, akhjärāt krtas tad icasta i krhlprokrit pratjāpartih prohrtrice ca lāralan, tells us that ric (that is, the termination aya) should be appended to a verbal aonn expressive of an eveot 10 the sease of narrating that event &ldquo;The derivative suffix is to be dropped, the noun reduced to the form of the ongidal root from which it is derived, and it is to this root that

the termination aja is to be appended ” By way of illustration, Patañjali says that, according to this Vārttika, the statement kamsam glātayatı would mean that one narrates the event of the kıllıng of Kamsa and the statement balım bandhayatı would mean that one parrates the event of the confinement of Balt Then, in his commentary on Vārttıka 7 - ākhyānac ca prati sedhah - Patan jalı poses the question is this rule applicable only in respect of the traditionally well knowo legends like the Kamsa-vadha or is it applicable also in respect of any pormal everyday happening whereby răjānam āgamajan may be used in the sense of rājāgama nam ācaste $6 We may not go into the details of this whole discussion For our present purpose it is enough to note that Patañjalı regards the killing of Kamsa and the confinement of Balı as traditionally well-established legendary eveots
In his commentary on Vārttika 15- kuriarah prayojaka iti cet tulyam - Patañjalı raises another question which is of great interest from various points of view The wausal forms glātajan and bandhayatı in the foregoing illustrations are of the present tense, while the events of Kamsa-vadba and Bait-bandha belong to a remote past How can these two things be reconciled ? Patañjalı explains the propriety of the present tense in this context in the following mapper the statement kamsam ghātaj at means (accor ding to Vārttika 6 ) that one conveys to others the information regarding the event of the killog of Kamsa This one can do 10 three ways-(a) through the presentation of that event on the stage or (b) by depicting the event pictorially or (c) by means of a direct narration So far as the stage presentatio0 is concerned, the producers of the play create the illusion, before our very eyes, of the actor playing the role of Krsna actually killing the actor play ing the role of Kamsa 67 Thus the present tense ghātayatı is quite appropriate in that context $8 Even in a picture, the artist

depicts the scene of the killing of Kamsa, with all the hits and blows of Kamsa and Krsoa in such a way that one feels as if the whole event is taking place in oce&rsquo;s very presence 5 Then there are the Paurānikas - Patañjalı uses the word granthika a hich Kaiyata explains as Kathaka (narrator) Through their remarkable narra. trve skill they make the episode of Kansa-vadha Live before their large audiences By means of suitable modulation of voice, often accompanied by corresponding gesticulation, they succeed in rousing the dormant emotions of their hearers, some of whom Spbconsciously sympathise with Kamsa and some with Vāsudera. And these their emotions then become manifest on their faces So, here too, the present tense is legitimate Patanku further adds that, in connection with this last, one actually finds all the three tenses being used One may say “Go to the Paräna Session, Kamsa 15 being Luled (that is, the Paurānik1 is just at the point of narratiog the killing of Kamsa)&rdquo; Or&rsquo; Go to the Porāna-session, Kamsa will soon be killed (that is, the Paurānika will soon commence the narration of the killing of Kansa) &quot; Or What is the use of attending the Purana-session LON? Kamsa is already killed (that is, the Pauranika has already finished the narration of the Killing of Kamsa)&rdquo;
A reference may be made here to certain incidental points which have emerged from this portion in Patanjali&rsquo;s commeotary on Vārttika 15 of P.

producer of a drama&rsquo; (see above), is, therefore, more or less conjectural It is suggested that Sobhanika may be a misreading for Saubhika or saubhika 6 But lexicons explain saubhika or saubhiha as juggler&rsquo; or &lsquo;conjurer'65 In that case, the present passage may be understood as alluding to a puppet-show, where the artist has to manipulate or juggle with the puppets, rather tban to a dramatic performance Or does it imply the drama producer&rsquo;s conjuring up an illusion of reality 260
KEITH also seems to have misunderstood the passage regarding the granthikas 67 He speaks of them as if they were performers of drama According to him, the granthikas divided themselves into two parts, one representing the followers of Kamsa with blackened faces, the other those of Krsna with red faces, and they expressed the feeling of both parties throughout the struggle from Krsna&rsquo;s birth to the death of Kamsa 68 He further adds &ldquo;The mention of the colour of the two parties 15 most significant red man slays black man the spirit of spring and summer prevails over the spirit of the dark winter 169 All this is patently farfetched The word granthika clearly denotes a narrator or a Pauranıka 70 The words, sabdagadumatram and Vācaksānäh, occurring in this context render this quite certain Again, the passage, Lecit kamsabhaktă bhavantı , does not refer to the granthikas dividing themselves into two parties It rather hints at the differing subconscious sympathies (bhakn) of the bearers, on account of which they are described as being vyāmisra

The legends relating to Vasudeva-Krsna occur in the Buddhist,&rdquo; the Jaina,and the Hindu literary texts There is every reason to presume that, apart from the Mahābharata, there existed in Patañjali&rsquo;s time some Kavyas of the classical type glori fying Vasudeva Krsna and his exploits Indeed, Patañjali has derived many of his illustrations from such Kavyas #o lo the context of the discussion regarding the Bahuvrihi compound, Patañjali, in his commentary on Varttika 22 of P II 2 24, poses the questiop as to why, in the verse-half samkarsanadvitiyasya balam hrsnasja vardhatām, the compound samkarsanadyja, and, in the verse-quarter asıdvitiyo &lsquo;nusasāra pāndavam, the compound asıdviriya should not take the dual number in accor dance with the rule dvajor dynacanam, and answers it by pointing out that the second member of those Bahuvrihi compounds, namely, dva, is to be understood in the sense of sahāya (com panion or helper) so that the question of twoness&rsquo; does not arise at all Leaving aside the grammatical point which Patañjalı has made here, we may only note what is relevant to our present purpose, namely, that Patañjali must have been familiar with a Kávya (or kāvyas ) - now, unfortunately, not available to us - dealing with Vāsudeva-Krsna and the Pandavassi from which he

Of course, Patañjal has his own explanation of this Incidentally, it may be pointed out that these verse quarters are understood by some scholars as belonging to one and the same contest, namely, the playing of musical instruments in festivals celebrated in the temple of Dhanapati-Răma-Keśava ** This does not, however, seem to be correct.

reference has already been made to the verse-quarter in the upendravajra metre, jaghāna hamsam kila vasudevah, which is quoted by Patañjatı as a counter-illutratiod in his commentary on Vārttıka 2 of P III 2 111 84
According to P VI 34 (manasah samjñāyām), the instru mental form manasā remains unchanged if it is the first member of a compound denoting a name eg manasādattà It remains unchanged also if the second member of the compound is ajñājin manasājñāyi (P VI 35 añäyını ca) Várttikas 1 (ārmanas ca pūrane )95 and 2 (anvārthe ca) of P VI 3 5 lay down that the same thing happens in respect of the instrumental form almanā in such compounds as ātmanāpañcamah However, this rule of aluh or the son dropping of the case-termination is applicable only to Tatpurusa compounds As a counter-illustration, Patañ jalı quotes in his commentary on Vārttika 2 the verse half in the upendravajra metre, janārdanas 11 atmacaturtha eva The com pound atmacaturtha is a Bahuvrihi compound, and so there is no aluk Apart from the fact that this verse quarter indicates Patañjali&rsquo;s familiarity with a Kāvya dealing with Vasudeva-Krsna, It is significant from another point of view also Janārdana or Vasudeva-Krsna here seems to be represented as being identical with a whole of which he himself is a fourth This is evidently a reference to the doctrine of Vyuhas It is suggested that Janārdana or Vasudeva-Krsna, while being, in a sense, identical with the totality of the four Vyūbas, is also one of those four Vyühas 88
Doubts have been expressed about the genuineness of this verse quarter quoted by Patañjalı on the ground that the doctrine of Vyühas had not developed in his time it is pointed out that

in the inscriptions of about that period, such as those of Ghosundi and Nanaghat,87 Samkarsana is given precedence over Vasudeva, while in the Vyüha-doctrine he is represented as being subordinate to Vasudeva It is, therefore, presumed that the Vyüba-doctrine toast not have been consolidated at the time of those inscriptions As also of Patanjal: It is, however, not improbable that the religious ideology in which Samkarana was superior to Vāsu deva was quite independent of the Vyüha-doctrine, and that the two ideologies prevailed contemporaneously The sorsdip of Samkarsana representing an independent religious sect must have been quite popular in early times 68 Presumably it arose more or less contemporaneously with Vasudevism, but it seems to have had a restricted sphere of influence One development in the religious history of that period was that the two independent religions, namely, the Samkarzana-religion and the Vasudeva-religion, came to be closely allied with each other the precedence in that alliance having been apparently gnen to Samkarsana ? Actually the two religious sects must have merged together on terms of equality Sankarsana was mentioned first only formaly, and that because he happened to be the elder one of the two Vrsai priaces who had been deified However, it was the Vasudeva-religion which became more dominant un course of time * The other develop ment, perhaps independent of the first, was in the direction of the
(Carlosed from the last page) doctrine of Vyühas, but that Visudeva-Krsda is called fanārdana i tu Passages in it (L. 36, I 39 T44 III 18 YT 51) Inadentally, Rāma, Laksmana, Bharata, and Satrughna are regarded as the four forms of the supreme god Rāma.

YON ORELLI (Allgemene Religionsgeschichte, 1899), S REINACH (Orpheus Histoire gerérale des religions, 1907), and A S BISHOP (The world&rsquo;s altar stars Introductory studies in The religions of the world, 1910) But these chapters are inevi tably more or less superficial in character It was Fasdrich MAX MULLER, who in his pioneering works like Lectures on the Onzu and Growth of Religion as illustrated by the Religions of Indu (1878), Natural Religion (1888), Physical Religion (1891), Anthropological Religion (1892), and Theosophy or Psychological Religion (1892). for the first time, occupied himself with the subject of Indian Relgions to a big way His aroned aim, however, was to develop a science of comparative religion and comparatne mythology Naturally, therefore, bis treatwent was restricted to the &lsquo;Aryan&rsquo; or the Vedic religion. Moreover, his approach cannot be said to have been that of a historian of religion, he was primarily interested in the content of religion. The same was the case with Forks like L YOX SCHROEDER&rsquo;S Arusche Religion (1914–16)

It was but to be expected that in such works as those mentio ned above the treatment of the two major sects of Hinduism, namely, Vaisnavism and Salvism, as also of the minor religious systems in Hinduism, would be sketchy and inadequate RGB, for the first time, undertook to trace the history of these sects and systems in a comprehensive manner on the basis of all available literary, epigraphical, sculptural, and numismatic evidence In keeping with the views regarding research methodology which he consistently advocated, his approach to and treatment of the subject were eminently objective, critical, and comparative Apart from the general Works on Indian religions mentioned above,</p>

Vaisnavism i! RGB&rsquo;s survey of Vaisnavism from about the fifth century before Christ to the middle of the seventeenth century after Christ may be broadly divided into three main parts to the first part he explains how that religious sect originated and how it passed through various stages of development before it fipally came to be consolidated in the form of what may be called classical Vaisna vism While this first part is historical in character, the emphasis in the second part is more on the doctrine In the eighth century A D, Samkarācārya vigorously promulgated the doctrine of spiritual monism and world-illusion&rsquo;-a doctrine which was const dered to be highly detrimental to the basic tenets of Vaisnavism It had to be confronted and refuted on a logical-metapbysical level and the religion of Bhakti had to be rehabilitated on sound rational basis This is exactly what Rāmānuja (11th century) strenuously endeavoured to do the same mission was carried forward, in their own distinctive ways, by Nimbārka (12th century), Madhya ( 13th century), and Vallabha (15th century)
The second part of RGB&rsquo;s survey deals with the thought and work of these Ācāryas An active sympathy for the lower classes and the use of vernaculars for the propagation of Bhaktı with special stress on its emotional side had become evident in the history of Vaişnavism ever since the days of Rāmānuja The compositions of the Alvars of the south would confirm this But these traits became more marked with Rāmānanda (born 1300 AD) They continued to be the hallmark of the teachings and activities of the later Vaisnava saints like Kabir ( 1398-1518) and Tulasidasa ( 1532-1623 ) in the north, Caitanya (1485-1533 ) in the east, and Nāmadeva (born 1270 ?) and Tukārīma (1607-1649) in the Deccan The discussion of these teachings and activities may be said to constitute the third part of RGB&rsquo;s survey of Varsnavism Out of these three parts it is the first which is particularly impor tant from the historical point of view, the other two parts being more or less of the nature of factual statement The first part is also more controversial aod calls for a critical re-appraisal, in the light of the fresh evidence that has become available, of som of the Joints made in it.

About the origia aad growth of Vaisnavison, RGB has to say this &ldquo;It (Vasnavism) first appeared as a religious reform, like Buddhism and Jalism, but based on theistic principles Its early Dame sras Ekantika Dharma, or the religion of a single-minded love and devotion to One In its background stood the Bhagavad gitá, a discourse professing to be preached by Vasudeva-Krsna. It soon assunod a sectarian form and w3s called the Pazcarátra or Bhagavata religion It was professed by a tribe of Ksatryas of the name of Sätrata and was noticed by Megasthedes, about the end of the fourth century before Christ, as the religion of such a specific people. Tais faith magled itself with the existing onc in Nārāyana and wib that in Visau in the Bhagavadgith itself Here embodied some of the teachings of the Upanisads Soon after the bridging of the Christian era another element was contributed to this system of religion by the Abhiras, or conherds, who belonged to a foreign tribe, in the shape of the marvellous deeds of the boy-Krsta, who came to be regarded as a god, and of his amorous dalliances with con herdesses So constituted, Vaisoavis kept on till about the end of the eighth cenivry &ldquo;11
When RGB says that Vaisnavsm first appeared as a reu gious reform, be seems to suggest that it was orthodor in ongo and that it represented an extension of Vedic thought in a particu lar direction According to him, the tide of free speculations initiated by the Upanisads culmida.ed 10 the east into such systems as Buddhism and Jardism and in the west into a theistic system with a god who had come to dnell among them The tendency to trace all religious ideologies - indeed, the entire Indian culture back to the Veda, in some way of the other, which characterised carly Todology, is evident here it must, however, be remembered that when the Vedic Aryans arsed so India they did not by any mcans step into a religious vacuum There is sufficient endence to show that differedt religious sects prevailed in diferent regions of the pre-Vedic non-Aryan India It is possible to identify at least tko such pre-Vedic non-Aryan cults Ope tpay designate</li>

them as the Muni-Yati-cult and the Bhakti-cult with a view to distinguishing them from the exotic Vedic Aryan cult which may be called the Rsi cult The Muni-Yati-cuit, with its emphasis on Yoga, Tapas, Sampyāsa, etc, was a characteristic feature of the pre-Vedic non Aryan Siva-religion of the Indus valley as also of the ancient Magadhan religious complex which served as the fountainhead of Jainism and Buddhism,1while the autochthonous character of Bhakti, as evidenced, among others, by its connec tions with the indigenous worship of the Mother-Goddess and the Nāga-and the Yaksa cults, its vegetal and fertility symbolism, and the bacchalian element in it, is now generally accepted 11 It can also be seen that the Muni-Yatı cult and the Bhakti-cult did not fail to influence the Rsi cult, both positively and negatively The Vedic religion adopted the pre-Vedic non-Aryan Śiva in the form of Rudra,s while it is not improbable that Vasistha&rsquo;s attitude towards Varuna reflects the influence of the Bhaktr-cult 26 Negati. vely, the hieratic Vedic religion exhibited obvious loathness for the Yatıs, the Sınadevas, and the Müradevas 17
On account of its freshness, energy, and flush of victory, the Vedic religion succeeded in keeping the indigenous popular reli gious sects suppressed for a fairly long time But when, about the end of the period of the major Upanisads (7th-6th centuries B C), the hold of Vedism, for obvious reasons, began to weaken, those popular religious cults again gatliered strength - indeed, to such an extent that they soon posed a serious challenge to the Vedic religion itself 19 There was, however, some difference in the attitudes of the religious sects mentioned above While Jainism and Buddhism openly revolted against the hegemony of

Vedism, the Bhaktı-religion, for some practical reasons, sought to establish a kind of liaison with it.
Bhaktı for a personal god constatates the very bernel of Vaisnavism. It would seem that the tbestic region, »ith Bhakti for the deified Vrsar hero Vasudeva (who, it may be emphasized, s not mentioned in any early Vedic text) as its central tenet, was one of the several sects which re-emerged as powerful religious forces in the days of the decline of Vedista incidentally, it may be noted that, like Vásudeva soho belonged to the tribe of the Vrstus, Mahāvīra and Gautama Baddha who consolidated their religious doctrines (the origin of which, as pointed out carlier, can be traced back to the pre-Vedic Magadhan thought complex), at about this very time also belooged to the tribes of the Jatrkas and the Sakyas respectively RGB has nghtly iodicated that the starting point of shat He today ander Stand by Vaisaasism was got the worship of Visco - it was the worship of Vasudeva This Vasudevis, bich represented the primary phase of Varpayit, naust have become fairly well established in the days of Panin (Sth century BC ), for, Panini was required to eduociate a special Sūtra (IV 3 93) governing the formation of the word rāsuderaka in the sense of a &ldquo;Bhakta or devotee of the pre-eminently worsłupful god vasudeva &ldquo;1) The tradition of the supreme godbead of Vasudeva acd of Vasudevism has been continuous since that time Megasthedes (4th century BC) speaks of the people of Sarasena who held Heracles (by whom Megastheces obviously meant Vasudeva-Krsna) in special Seneration. As pointed out by RGB, a Niddesa passage also suggests that Vasudeva-Torship prevailed in the 4th century BC* &ldquo;The Bhagavadgită (3rd century B C ) eulogises the man of knowledge, who at the end of several births, betakes himself unto the Lord 10 the conviction that “ Vástdeva is AU (VII 19) Ye

then have the Besnagar inscription, belonging to the last quarter of the second century BC, on the Garudadhvaja of Vāsudeva, the god of gods, erected by Heliodoros, the Bhāgayata, the son of Dian and an inhabitant of Taksasili
The historical tradition that the god Vasudeva originally belonged to the tribe of the Vrsnis is well attested ' For instance, in the Bhagavadgitā, the Lord unequivocally declares that of the Vrsnis he is Vasudeva (X 37) The Mahābhāsya of Patañjalı (150 B C ) also clearly speaks of Vasudeva as belonging to the Vrsni tribe 22 Again, as pointed out by ROB, Vasudeva is closely related to the other deified Vrsni hero Samkarsana in the Ghosundi stone inscription of Sarvatāta, belonging to the second half of the first century BC, and the Nanaghat cave jöscription of the Satavahana queen Nāgapikā of the first century B C %3 The Kāśikā emphasizes this close relationship between Samkarsana and Vāsudeva by giving the example, dvandyam sam karsananāsudaiau, to illustrate P VIII 1 15, atjantasahacarite lokaviñāte diandram Ity upasamhlyanam
Though the religion centering round the popular god Vásu. deya had become well established since before Panini&rsquo;s time, it is strange that the Buddhist canonical text Amguttaranikaya,44 which mentions such religious sects as the Ajivikas, the Nirgranthas, the Mundafrāvakas, etc, does not refer to the Vasudevakas Simi larly Aśoka&rsquo;s inscriptions, which mention the Śramapas, the Brāhmanas, the Ajivikas, and the Nirgranthas, do not speak of the Vasudevakas The only possible explanation of this would be that Vāsudevism, which was naturally restricted to the regions dominated by its chief promoters, namely, the Vrsojs, the Sātvatas, and the Yadayas-Ābhiras, had not will then spread far towards Eastern India which was the provenance of Buddhism As against this, it was well known to Papini of Takşasılā as also to Megasthenes, and it attracted, in course of time, even

nous religious sects among sh.ch are iccluded the worshippers of Vasudesa and Baladera. So far as Jainism is concerned, it seems to have been more positively responsive to Väsuderism. Ths Vasudeva-legends have markedly influenced the Jain2 hagio logy, particularly its concept of suty-three cläkāpuruscs who comprise, among others, nine Vasudevas, cine Baladeras, and ane Prativísuderas
Another striking point about the Vásudet-religion is that the word tāsuderaha, in the sense of a Bhakta of Vasudeva, is cot attested in any available literary work. On the other hand, since a descriptive grammaria lie Panini has devoted a separats Sutra to the morphology of that word, it must have been farly common in his time. We are, therefore, constrained to assume that cons.derable Literature of pop-Vedic characters existed in Parni&rsquo;s time but that it 15 now lost to us *

Further, from the manner in which they have been referred to by Panini, it may be assumed that these two cults were closely allied to each other - the Vasudeva cult having been regarded, even at that time, as being superior to the Arjuna-cult In the Rgvedic mythology, Visnu is closely associated with Jodra 28 According to Sotapatha Brāhniana II 1 2 11 and V 4 3 7, Arjuna is a secret or mystical (guhja) name of Indra, while, a later Vaisna vism, the personality and character of Vedic Visnu have been merged into those of Vāsudeva 29 Therefore, the alliance between the Vasudeva-sect, with which Pánını seems to have been familiar, may be said to correspond, in a way, with the alliance between Vişnu and Indra 80 Another prototype of such an alliance is to be seen in the religious ideology pertaining to Nara and Nārā. yana, 31 wherein Nara may be regarded as the alter ego of Indra (of the Rgeda) and Arjuna (of P IV 398) and Nārāyana as that of Visou (of the Rgveda) and Vasudeva (of P IV 398) It would seem tbat, even in the joitial stages of their history, the Vasudeva sect subdued and subsumed within itself the Arjuna sect 32 That would account for the fact that no traces of this latter sect have been preserved either in history or literature
RGB has not said much about the Samkarsana-religion, though he has suggested that Samkarsana might have originally been a god outside the Vaisnava pantheon 33 Like the Arjuna religion, the Samkarsana-religion also seems to bave arisen as an independent religion, but, unlike the former, its historical deve

lopment can be reconstructed from literary and archaeological sources in the Mahabharata, Samkarseda or Balarama is repre sented as a Vrsai hero, the elder son of Vasudeva and Rohini, but he does not play any siguificant role in the great cpic.&rdquo; The earliest literary reference to the Samkarsana-cult is to be foord in Rounlira-Arthašāstra (4th century BC) XIII 367, a hicb speaks of the spies disguised as the ascetic worshippers of Samkarsana IAdolgence io intoucating drinks seems to have been a special feature of that cult Megasthenes says that Dropysus ( = Bacchus, God of wine) is represented in India by three gods, and from the further description it becomes clear that, according to the Greek writer, one of them is Samkarsana to the intral stages of its evolution, the Sankarsana-calt was closely related to the Nāga cult-a fact which later led to the belief that Samkarsana was an Avatāra of Sesa or Adapta-Naga Sankarsapa&rsquo;s copfections with Inebrety and the stake-cult further led to his belog often identi fied with Rudra-Siva in the Pāñcarátra-Samhitas 25 A further piece of evidence in support of the assumption that the Sam karsana-religioc must have originated independently of the Yāsu desa-religion is the Mathură sculpture of the second century B C., depicting Samkarsana by himself. It is however, not correct to say that Samlarsana was originally a non-Brabmancal agricultural dexty which later came to be destified asth Balarama, 3* for, Samlarsana and Balarādia novaere appear as two separate Ludividuals
The worship of Sankarsana constituting an independent religious sect may be thus presumed to have ansen more or less contemparageously with Vasudevism, but its sphere of influence seems to have been rather restricted Soon, the two independent religions, namely, the Samkarsana-religion and the Vasudeva.

The other development in the religious history of that same period -a development which must bave been independent of the first, namely, the alliance on equal terms between the Samkarsana religion and the Vasudeva-religion &ndash; was in the direction of the evolution of the doctrine of the Vyuhas Though the doctrine of the Vyühas, in its developed form, first occurs in the Nārāyaniya section (early centuries of the Christian era )40 11 is adumbrated

RGB says that Vasudeva was also called Krsoa because bus gotta was Kársaiyana * In thus condection he emphasizes the Vedic affiliations of Krsna by pointing out that one Krsni Angi rasa is the Rsi of RV VIII 74, that the same Krsna Angira sa is mentioned in KB 30 9, and that Krsna occurs in the Chandau ga-Upanisad as the pupil of Ghora Angirasa The Vedic seer Krsoa could thus have been a founder of a gorra RGB further adds that, though Vasudeva belonged to the Ksatriya family or the Vrsnis, he must have adopted the gotra of his Brāhmaga priest for sacrificial purpose. 3 In support of his assumption, RGB refers to the commentary of the Ghara-Jätaka which seems to suggest that Vasudeva belonged to the Kānhāyan3 gorra AN this argument, however, is rather farfetched Even assuming that Vasudeva did adopt the Kārsnīyana gotra, one would not be able to explain why Vasudeva was called Krsna He might have called himself Kärscāyana, but not Krspa One hardly finds a person adopting the name of the founder of his gorra as his additional personal name The commentary of the Ghara-Jataka, which 100 is a little confused about the gorra-dame and the personal name, obviously represents a later tradition Incidentally, Krsna of the Chándogya-Upanısad need not have been a Brāhmana scer
Another assumption, wtuch is often made up this context, is that, from the very beginning, Krsoa was an additional personal name of Vasudeva of the Vrsnis * It is however, rather dousual

Again the etymologies of the word vasudeva given by the Maha. bhārataand Ujjvaladatta&rsquo;s gloss of Unādısūtra I 1&rdquo; would leave po doubt that Vasudeva was regarded as the onginal name and not a patronym 60 JACOBI mentions the fact,s1 which is particu.

Though RGB does not consider Yādasa Krsna to have been distinct from Vrsai Vasudeva, he does believe that the Gopāla Krspa element #25 introduced to Visudevisnt at a fauly late stage in tbe development of the latter &quot; He points out that no reference to Gopāla Krsna occurs in the epigrap ucal records like the Ghosundi and the Nanaghat Inscriptions, nor does it occur wa the Mahabhäsja of Patañjalı or even in the Nārāyaniya section of the Afahabhārara No doubt, 10 the Sabhāpatvan, Sisapāla is represented as referring tauotingly to Krsna&rsquo;s exploits&rsquo; in the Gokula, like the killing of Pūtapā,« but RGB regards that passage as an interpolation Similarly he accepts the interpretation of Kisa&rsquo;s name Govinda, given in the Adiparyan and the Soupar vau, as &ldquo;fader of the earth&rdquo;, thereby rejecting any suggestion regarding Krsca having been connected with the cons Honever, be hasteus to add that, care probably, the game means “finder of the cows ” Finally he concludes that the story of Krsna&rsquo;s boybood in the Gokula was doknown till about the beginning of the Christus era, that it occurs w its full-fledged form only m the Hanıramsa, the Vāvu-Purând, and the Bhagarata-Purând, that some of the elements in the Gopāla Krsna mythology, which clearly betray Christus influence, such as, the worship of the boy god and the story of his humble buth, his reputed father&rsquo;s kuon. Jedge that he has not his son, and the massacre of the innocents, were brought into India by the Abhiras when they migrated into this country in the first century A D , and that the Abhiras possibly brought with them abo the name Christ, which probably led to the identification of the boy-god with Vasudeva-Krsna

There can be little doubt that the religion centering round the cowherd child-god Krsna originated among the Domadic cowherd community of the Abhiras « In the Padma-Purand, the supreme god is represented as announcing that he would be born among the Abhiras in his eighth incarnation 65 Similarly, in the Harnamsa and the Balacarita&rdquo; of Bhāsa, Krsna is said to have been brought up in a ghosa, and, according to the Amarakoša, se ābhirapalli is a synonym of ghosa The religious cult of Gopāla Krsna abjured the lodra dominated Vedic religion (as is evidenced by the Govardhana-episode ) and promoted religious sublimation of sensuous Jove (cf the relationship between Krsna and the Gopis)
We need not here go into the question of the origin of the Abhiras Whether they were a foreign tribeor an aboriginal one living in Panjab,&rdquo; there is sufficient evidence to show that they were in India already in the third century BC&rdquo; So RGB&rsquo;s suggestion regarding the Christian influences brought in by the Abhiras cannot be sustained 72 Again, the so-called similarities between the legends pertaining to Gopala Krsna and Christ, to which RGB refers, are patently superficial Atteotion may also be drawn to a Mathurā sculpture, depicting Vasudeva as crossing the Yamunā with the baby Krsoa in a basket, which has been assigned to the Kusāna period 73 This may be taken to prove

affiliations of Abhira Gopāla Krsna As against this, Indra is often described in the RV as govid (=finder of cows ), but Gopāla Krsna, as we have seen, asks his followers to desist from Indra worship and to regard cons as their deities The original non Vedic character of the Gopāla-Krsna-cult is thus beyond doubt
It would seem that the Gopāla-Krsna-religion of the Abbiras was, in course of time, engrafted on the organically united Vasudeva-Krsna religion of the Vrsnis-Yādavas 81 This must have happened some time before the third century BC, for, the Bhagavadgita contains the words govindas2 and heśınısüdana 3 which are reminiscent of Krsna&rsquo;s boyhood days in the Gokula Similarly, Katyāyana (3rd century BC) found it necessary to add a Vārttika to P III 1 138 to explain the morphology of the name Govinda84 which must have become fairly common in his days The words damodara and govinda, which definitely belong to the Gopāla-Krsna religious complex, also occur in the Baudha Jana-Dharmasūtra (If 5 24 ) of about the same period
The amalgamation of the Vasudeva-religion of the Vrsnis, the Kfsna-religion of the Yādavas, and the Gopāla-religion of the Abhiras gave rise to what may be called a new Krsnatsm If, as pointed out earlier, Vāsudevism represented the first phase of classical Vaisnavısm, this new Krsnaism represented its second (and perhaps most outstanding) phase New legendary links were forged whereby Vasudeva, Kysna, and Gopāla were integra ted into a single homogeneous mythological pattern Vasudeva, who, as the result of the merger of the Vasudeva-religion and the Kpna religion, had already come to be regarded as Krsoa&rsquo;s

We need not here analyse in detail the Visou-mythology in the Rgveda Suffice it to say that it symbolises an important motif in the evolution of Vedic mythology, namely, hierarchisation of popular religion Visnu was originally a popular dividity of fertility and growth, conceived (as in several primitive mytho. logies) in the form of bird $6 However, popular pressure seems to have rendered it necessary to admit Visou in the hieratic Vedic pantheon The artificiality of this mythological elevation of Visou is indicated by the forced manner in which he has been brought into association with Indra, who was, as it were, the philosopher&rsquo;s stone in the matter of hierarchtsation And, when Visou was thus being related to Indra, the Vedic poet-priest took care to suppress the original fertility traits in Visnu s character and to superimpose on him the conventional solar character RGB 15, indeed, right in not stressing the Rgvedic Visou&rsquo;s identity with the sun The superimposition of solar character on Visnu was presumably facilitated by the common symbol of bird&rsquo; which represented both the fertility-divioity and the sun In the course of the further evolution of the Visnu-mythology, Vişnu came to be regarded as the supreme (parama) god from the ritualistic point of view 67 It was, however, his character as a

in the Baudhāyana Dharnasūtra,&quot; which belongs to about the same period as the Bhagavadgita, Visnu is called Govinda and Dāmodara, and in the Taittiriya- Aranyaka,&quot; which is a little posterior to the Bhagavadgitā, he is identified with Vasudeva and Nārāyana The identity of Vāsudeva with Visnu is also suggested by the fact that, in the Besnagar inscription, Vasudeva&rsquo;s column is called Garuda column Further, according to WEBER,&quot; the fact that, in Patanjali&rsquo;s commentary on Vārtika 6 of P III 1 26, the episodes of Kamsavadba (of which Krsna is the hero) and Balibandha (of which Visnu is the hero) have been mentioned together, shows that Krsna and Visnu stood in close relationship with each other 100 Similarly, it is significant that a coin of the Vr$o1-rājanyagana of the first century B C bears the two emblems of Visou cakra on the reverse and Garuda on the observe lol Incidentally it may be mentioned that, in the Mahabharata, the Dame Visnu occurs less frequently than the dames, Vasudeva, Krşna, and Nārāyana
Two points need to be specially noted in connection with the assimilation of the Visnu element by Krsnaism Firstly, when Visnu came to be assimilated into Kęşgaism, there occurred a vital change in his character in the Rgvedic mythology, Visou is represented as a subordinate ally of Indra In Krsnaism, Visnu not only supersedes Indra but, in his role as Krsna, he actively antagonises him The legends concerning the Govardhana moud. tain and the Părijāta tree would confirm this 102 Secondly, it is not quite correct to characterise the assimilation of the Visqu

clement into Krsnaism as the &lsquo;Brahmapisation&rsquo; of Kisaasm, for, it actually resulted in the Krsna isation of Visou rather than 10 the Vissursation of Krspa No significant Brahmanic traits are seen to have been introduced into Krsgaism together with the Visau element Indeed, the position of Vipu jo this entire petly evoked religious complex is such as would hardly justify that religious complex being designated as Vaisnavism The only indication of Visau&rsquo;s predominance is to be found in the newly propagated belief that Kisha was an dyatāsa or incarnation of Visnu
The araráras constitute a special characteristic of Vaisna135m. RGB has ooted the vanous references to aratăras, 10 but he has not discussed the gralăra-theory as such. The oatāra-theory is essentially purpose-onented in the Bhagavadgitā, the Lord declares that, whenever Dharma (righteousness ) languishes and Adharma (unrighteousness) thrles, be jocarpates himself The moral aspect of the aratărc-theory is emphasized by suggesting that god comes down to man in order that man may strive to become god by following bus example 105 The aratára-theory also facilitated the transcendent being brought into direct relation with the phenomenal world It promoted the doctrines of Bhakti and grace by providig their very sine que non, namely, a personal god Further, the avatāra-theory gave the psychologically much needed assurance that god tas not merely an indifferent and bainterested spectator of the world-process which he bad initiated but that he was responsibly involved in t From the point of view of the history of Hinduism, the aratára theory may be said to have helped the synthesis of various religious sects which that religion had sought to accomplish It integrated into a sugle scheme the presıdıpg divinities of those sects by regarding them

The Bhagavadgitā reflects the stage of Krsnaism after it had assimilated the Vispu element RGB gives a detailed chapterwise summary of the BG He also discusses at some length the sour ces of the religion of the BG.107 RGB is too prone to trace the origin of most of the teachings of the BG to the Upanisads Thus, for instance, he connects (not quite convincingly!) the BG do ctrine of Karmayoga with the insistence of the Ita-Upanisad(st 2) on man&rsquo;s doing actions resolutely for a hundred years coupled with the idea of non-contamination resulting from an elevated state of mind as spoken of in Chandogja-Upan sad IV 14 3, Brhadāranyaka-Upanisad IV 23, and Mauri-Upanısad VI 20 Further, according to RGB, the BG derives the attributes of the Supreme, the concept of brahmanirvāna, and even the teaching of Bhaktı from the Upanisadic sources It would, however, seem that, in the matter of essential attitude and doctrine, the BG represents a kind of reaction against the prevailing Vedic ideo logy It must be said to have adequately responded to the needs of the hour Broadly speaking, the major Upanisads, which mark the acme of the religio-philosophical culture of the Vedas, teach that the ultimate goal of human life is the realisation of the essential identity of the individual soul and the universal soul which results from the complete withdrawal from the fundament ally unreal phenomenal world The Upanisadıc attitude is thus individualistic and, to a large extent, negative As against this, the BG emphasizes the ideal of lokasamgraha -of the stability, solidarity, and progress of the society The society cao fuaction properly only on the principle of the ethical interdependence of Its various constituents Man must, therefore, see to it that, as an essential constituent of society, he furthers this process of lokasamgraha through an active awareness of his social obligations

RGB&rsquo;s analysis of the Narajanījalt! is excellent, but it does not throw much light on how and why the Nārāyana-element might have been merged into Vásudevism-Kţsnaism The several references to the ascetics-yogins associated with Nārāyana in Badarı or Svetadvipaat would indicate that the Nara-Nārāyana cult had originated independently of the Veda, but the connection of Nārāyana with the Indus valley civilization cannot be validly

In the Satapatha-Brahmana XIII 6 1, Purusa Nára. yana is said to have performed a Purusamedha extending over five Dights whereby he superseded all beings and himself became identical with the All Presumably, it was this latter reference which gave rise to the tradition of Nārāyana being associated with the famous cosmological hymn, the Purusosukta (RVX 90 ),139 as its Rs. But what seems to have facilitated the merger of Nārāyana toto Vasudeviso-Krsoais (which was intended to serve the same purpose as the merger of Vuspo) was not so much hus cosmic character and function as his dual personality as Purisa Nārāyana Correspondence could be easily established among the four pairs, namely, Nara-Nārāyana of Badarikäsrama, Perusa-Nārāyana of the Satcrarha-Brahmana, Indra-Visnt of the Rgvedic mythology, and Arjuna-Vasudeva of Vasudevism Krsaalstu.

Compared to Vaisnatism, the origin of Saivism is more obvi ous and its bustorical evolution less complex. Accordiog to RGB, the beginnings of Sansm have to be traced back to the Vedic god Rudra who personified the dreadful and destructive pheno mena of “the storms that uproot trees and even demolish houses, accompanied by the thunderbolt which strikes down men and beasts dead in a moment and the epidemics that rage and carry off numbers of men &quot; }{5 Rudra (from the root rud to honl&rsquo;) went about howlog with the stormy finds (Manuts) who were his sons (Rudrijas) RGB further adds that these dreadful phenomena trere the result of the wrath of Rofra which, how eser, could be appeased with prayer, praise, and offenng Rudra then became Sta or the benignant one to the RV, Rudra stood for the destructive agency of lightning But when he was daly propitiated with prayers, he became pasupă protector of the cattle. (I 114 9) Rudra caused dueases, but he also possessed the healing remedies (I 43 4) This ambivalent character of Rodra was often emphasized in the RV The conception of the Vedic Rudra gradually developed further until, as seen in the Sala rudnia (TS IV 51, VS 16), he became the god &ldquo;of wild and awful scenes, such as cemeteries, mountains and forests. Of the beasts and savages that dwelt io these last and of the threses and outcasts that resorted to them, he became the lord&rdquo; 119 Subsequ ently he developed into the god who pervaded the uonerse, dwelt in fire and water, in all beings, and in herbs and trees, and thus became the supreme ruler of all.

even in the Ry, Rudra was represented as having risen to supreme power (VII 46 2 It was in this form that the god became &ldquo;the subject of Up,unisad speculation, by meditating on whom and seeing whom everywbere in the universe a man attained bliss ful serenity &quot; 117
This theory put forth by RGB is characterised by the two common assumptions of early Indology, namely, (1) that the origin of everything Indian has ultimately to be traced back to the Veda and (2) that the Vedic gods are basically personifica. tions of natural phenomena It, however, needs to be emphasized that the real popular religion, which was essentially distinct from the Vedic religion, remaiped outside the purview of the Veda The Veda, it must be realised, does not teach us everything on ancient social and religious conditions of even Aryan India It may be said to have emanated from a parrow circle of poet priests, and reflects a somewbat singular view of things 148 Long before the advent of the Vedic Aryans, there had prevailed in various parts of India widely spread and deeply rooted popular religious cults Though they might have apparently suffered a kind of set back on account of the onslaught of the freshly vigorous Vedic way of life and thought, some of them proved influential enough to compel the sponsors of Vedism to accommodate them, in one form or another, in the framework of their religious ideology, And when, in the course of the religious history of India, Vedismi began gradually to decline, these popular religious cuits again came into their own and confirmed themselves as the religion of the people Such, in broad outline, is the genesis of Vaisnavism, Saivism, and other minor religious sects which together constitute the major part of the classical Hiaduism It has been rightiy observed that these religious sects are of a fairly ancient date though their positive history is comparatively modern
How a pre-Yedic non-Aryac religion was adopted into the Vedic religious ideology is perhaps best illustrated by the pers

Onality and character of Vedic Rodra 143 From a corsory study of the varios references to Rudra in Vedic literature, one gens. rally gets the impression that two distinct Rudras are presented in that iterature - the Rgsedic Rudra, 29 who is a heavenly god
7th Marots as his hosts, and the post-Rgvedic Rodra, who is earthly in character and is associated with evil spints and dread fol beings However, the basic identity of these two Rudras is quite onmistakable A critical consideration of the came, the outward appearance, and certain special features of these two Rudras would leave no doubt about this The distinction between the two Rudras is only apparent and is occasioned by varying emphasis
It is a verred that the Vedic gods, in contrast with the Greek gods for instance, lack concretepess and &ldquo;lifefolness&rsquo;, their characterisation tends to become stereotyped and conventiodal, and, therefore, pale and colourless Redra does not play any very important role in Vedic mythology and ntual, and yet, more particulars are given to the Veda about his personality and chara. cter than about those of many other gods As has been rightly pointed out, Rudra has more body&rsquo; than the others He is shown as possessing a distinctie and more or less well-defined individuality He is clearly isolated from other Vedic gods 1 respect of appearance, dress, and other paraphernalia For instance, he is said to be brown (babhru I 33 5) or red in compleuon (VS 16 7) He is blue-necked ( IS 16 7) and blue tufted ( AV II 27 6), his belly is black and his back red ( AV XV 1 7-8) He is hapardır (f 114 1,5) and wears a multiform Decklace (niska) as his special ornament (11 33 10) He is also described as being clothed in a bide (VS 3 61, 16 51) The Autareya-Brāhmana (V 2 9) speaks of Rudra as appearing in a dark dress

Rudra is essentially ambivalent in character (which fact 15 duly noticed by RGB) He is described as a fierce god (II 33 9, 11, X 126 5), destructive like a terrible beast (11 33 11 ), un assailable and unsurpassed in might (I 114 4, II 33 3) Mention is frequently made of Rudra&rsquo;s death-bringing Missiles (If 33 10) As a matter of fact, fear of Rudra&rsquo;s terrible shafts and deprecation of his wrath and ill will may be said to be the ruling sentiments of a large number of Rgvedic passages concerning Rudra (II 33 4-6, 15) Rudra&rsquo;s very pame 18 frightening (II 33 8) It is to be never directly mentioned In the post-RV Vedic litera ture, Rudra&rsquo;s malevolence and wrathfulness are more frequently referred to and deprecated (VS3 61, AV XI 2) According to the Altareja-Brahmana (I]I 33), Rudra is the compound of the terrible forms of the gods, while the Sarapalha-Brāhmana (IX. 1 1 1, 6) says that even gods are afraid of hin But Rudra is not exclusively malevolent and maleficent For, he is said to bestow blessings on his worshippers (I 114 1, 2, II 33 6) and generally look after the welfare of man and beast (1 43 6) He sees to it that the inhabitants of a village are well fed and free from disease (1 114 1) But by far the most significant reference in this coonection is the one to Rudra&rsquo;s great healing powers He is the physician of physicians ( II 33 4), whose remarkable remedies are often praised by the Rgvedic poets (I 114 5, II 33 7, 12, V 42 11, VII 46 3) Rudra&rsquo;s healing powers are referred to also jo the post-RV Vedic literature (AV II 27 6, VS 3 59, 16 5,49), but less frequently than his frightful and destructive nature This double personality&rsquo; of Rudra seems to have been regarded by the Rgvedic poets as the special distinguishing feature of that god Abrahmodya stanza (VIII 29 5) indirectly speaks of Rudra as a god, who is at once ferocious (ugra) and bright and holy (suur), and who wields in his hand a sharp weapon (tigma ayudha) and at the same time possesses marvellous healing powers (alasabhesaja )
Similarly, on the one hand, Rudra is called the ruddy boar of the heaven (1 114 5), or the great Asura of the heaven (II I 6), wbile, on the other, the Satarudrija associates him with various

kinds of people and places on the earth. He is glonfied as the lord of thueves, pilferers and plunderers (VS 16 20-22) Not only this, he is himself charactersed as robber and prowler (eren In RI L 114 4, Rudra is referred to as ranku kari), cheater and decenser (ibid) 11 In the Satarurija, Rudra is presented with all the characteristics of purely popular origin - as a figure so real 10 popular consciousness As so appositely obsersed by BARTH, &ldquo;We can concene nothing more life-like than the figure which stands out from this piece of rede realism, but nothing, at the same time, less Brahmanic * In this opesual litany, we hardly come across any espression bearidg on ritual or any allusion to a sacred custom Rudra certainly does cot appear here as a sosereigo god, but there are clear indications that he must have originally been on
Rudra does not enjoy any position of prominepce and honour in the Srauta ntual He is either drien back to his hone&rsquo;as in the Agnihotra, 13 or only the remanants of oblations are assigned to him 15 As agaust thus, Rudra plays a particularis important role in certain grhya or popular rites such as the Sulagara lot the Aśraydi, and the Prstakā Thus, while Rodra is generally excluded from the homas offered in buerarchical ntual, he is very positively represented as being entitled to the balis offered in folk-cult ntes.
On account of all such features Rudra stands out almost segregated from the federality of Vedic gods 175 Notsithstand ing this the Veda cannot be said to exhibit any open opposition

to Rudra-worship as such There is no doubt that the Rudra-cult was entirely alien to the Vedic milieu, but, voder the pressure of certain peculiar circumstances, it bad to be accommodated, how soever haltiogly, into the Vedic religious complex
Attention may now be drawn to certain other characteristics of the Vedic Rudra In the Rgieda, Rudra is closely associated with Maruts It would, however, seem that the hosts of Rudra were originally called Rudras, that, when Rudra was admitted into the Vedic pantheon munly as god of death, he was deli berately brought into relationship with Maruts who had onigl pally been independent divinities and were regarded as the hosts of the spirits of the dead, and that this relationship of Rudra with Maruts, which was frankly tendentious, proved to be but short lived Rudra&rsquo;s affinity with Agni, on the other hand, is perhaps more constant and enduring Indeed, in some passages, Rudra seems to have been actually identified with Ago (II I 6, AV VII 87 1, TS V 4 3 1) But this is obviously just incidental and not essential The word rudra was primarily used as ad epithet of Agni, but later it tended to be interpreted as another nane of Agni It is also natural that the terrific form (ghorā tanah) of Agni should be referred to as rudra (TS 11 2 2 3) The legend that on a certain occasion, Agni wept and was, therefore, called Rudra (TS II 2 10)167 is pateptly an afterthought On the contrary, it is not improbable that, since, on account of his peculiar character and associations, Rudra&rsquo;s name was taboo among the Vedic poet priests, he was often represented as conceal ing under the names of Agn, 158 And, if Rudra was really identi cal with Agon, how could one explain Rudra&rsquo;s peculiar position in the hieratic Vedic ritual 2169 As against this, the points of simila.

But it is Rodra&rsquo;s unmistakable connection with certain reli gods cults of ancient times which thrors a very suggestite Light on the essental personality and character of that god The Kesin hymn (X 136), for instance, relates to the orgastic cult of the Munis who are said to have mora loog hair, indulged in a sort of ecstasy-producing potion, and attained certain miraculous powers which were comparable to those attained through Yoga, aod, in that hymn, Rudra is iepresented almost as the leader of that calt (X. 136 7) The cult of the Brabmacirns 15 glorified in AV XI 55 These Brahmacãrins practised sesere penance and thereby became endoved with peculiar virile powers which enabled them to undertake creo cosmic activities The description of the Brahmacānın tends to remaid oge of Vedic Radra Similar is the Case of the Vratyas (AV XV who had dexeloped their own distinctive religious ideology, social order, and general way of life.

The most common theory regarding the character of Rudra is that he is the roaring storm god who is both frightful and bene. ficent RGB has endorsed this theory without any discussion, but specifying that Rudra represented the destructive agency of light. Ding According to him, the simple folk working in the field saw in the black cloud tinged red by the soft glow of the lightning god Rudra with his blue neck and red complexion 102 In the present context, it is neither possible nor necessary to subject this theory to any critical examination Suffice it to say with OLDENBERG that, in the Vedic descriptions of Rudra, lightings do not flash, rains do not pour down, winds do not rush forth 165 Therefore, at least in the consciousness of the Vedic poets, Rudra was not a god of tempest 164 Moreover that theory miserably fails to explain, rationally and satisfactorily, the complex personality of Rudra with its distinctive and exclusive features as set forth above As for Rudra&rsquo;s identification with Agni, it has already been shown to be just incidental and not essential 165 According to OLDEN BERG,168 who considers Rudra&rsquo;s connection with mountains and forests to be far more vital and essential than that with storm and lightaing, characterises that god as the Old Man of the Mountains, a demon of disease coming from forest and mountain, like Mars Silvanus But while emphasizing one significant aspect of Rudra&rsquo;s character, 167 OLDENBERG has completely ignored other equally or

even more important aspects AREVANTS, like OLDENBERG, rejects the theory that Rudra is the god of thunderstorm or that he personifies any other phenomenon of oature According to him, Rudra is an unheareply product of lover mythology, an earthly, depopic, fearfol god who has ongnated from the primi tire concepts of death and its fears He further asserts that Rgredic Rudra represents an artificial side growth of the contr nuous line of development from the orginal primite pon-Vedic Rodra to the later Vedic Rudra, and then to the epic Susa

ritual in which Rudra figures confirm his character as god of death in the Sikamedha, for instance, there is a funeral cere mony which includes an offering to Rudra Incidentally it may be pointed out here that according to the primitive belief, the god of death and his hosts also bestowed fertility on land, animals, and human beings It also needs to be added that, since the entire concept relating to Rudra was foreign to the Vedic ideology, the character of that god was not clearly defined in the Veda, and the emphasis often shifted from one aspect of his character to another &ldquo;That is why Rudra cannot be said to have been re presented in the Veda as god of death either exclusively or consistently
The following points will now have been clear from the fore going discussion (1) that Rudra was essentially different from the normal hieratic Vedic gods, (2) that he belonged to a milieu which was foreign to the Vedic poet priests, (3) that the Vedic poet-priests must have accommodated him in their religious complex under the pressure of circumstances, and, therefore, reluctantly and almost under protest, (4) that, while doing so, they either suppressed or transformed many of that god&rsquo;s essential traits, and (5) that, as a result of this, only one aspect of Rudra&rsquo;s original complex character, namely, that of the god of death came to be generally emphasized in the Vedic literature One does, however, get a few glimpses of Rudra&rsquo;s original complex character from various stray references to that god in the Veda Indeed, some indications are avajlable in the Vedic literature itselt of the rise of Rudra, in the form of Rudra-Siva, to the position of supreme godhead For instance, various references 10 AV XV suggest Rudra&rsquo;s correspondence with Ckavratya (XV 1) and with Bhava, Sarva, Pasupati, Ugra Deva, Mahadeva, and ifāna (XV 5) Aod, already jo the Mauryani-Samhita II 9 1, Rudra is identified with Purusa and Mabadeva
There is sufficient evidence to justify the assumption that Rudra is but the Vedic version of a well established pre-Vedic non Aryan popular god The religious cult centering round this proto Indian god had spread far and wide-different aspects of

The proto-Indian god was celebrated as &lsquo;red god&rsquo; in some circles, particularly among the proto Dravidians They called him by the name Sıva (which proto-Dravidian word means the * red one&rsquo;), because they worshipped him, among other things, by pouring over (Tamil pūcu from which the word pūjá is derived) his icon the blood of the animal, more particularly the buffalo (or, in some cases, even the human being ), which was offered to him, and, as a consequence of this, the god actually looked red Vedic Rudra has borrowed not only the name but also some characteristics of the red god The word, rudra, has to be derived from a hypothetical lost root, rud, which must have meant to be ruddy or red 170 Thus, Rudra, like proto-Dravidian Śiva, also means the red god As pointed out earlier, Rudra is actually associated with the red colour in a variety of ways He is des cribed as being arusa (1 114 5), babhru (II 33 5), tâmra, aruna, vilohuta, nilalohita ( 7S IV 51, VS 16 6,7) Like the proto Indian Sıva, Rudra also is offered Bali (and not homa) as in the Sūlagava rite Rudra&rsquo;s fondness for blood is frequently referred to The TS (II 1 7 lff ), for instance, narrates the legend of vasathāra breaking open the head of gayatri On that occasion, we are told, the gods took the various juices issuing out of that head But Rudra chose only the blood The Āpss (X 13 11 ) seems to refer to blood as Rudra&rsquo;s water in the Afva medha, the blood of the horse is assigned to Rudra (TS I 4 36), and, according to the Satapatha Brāhmana (V 3 1 10), Rudra longs for the cows slaughtered in the royal palace in the Rājasuya Red colour is also suggestive of death magic, evil omen, swear ang, cursiog, misfortune, etc And it can be shown that both proto-Dravidian Siva and Vedic Rudra were intimately conoccted with these concepts implied by the red colour

ther pantheon, they naturally sought either to suppress or to transform many of his characteristic features For instance, they retained the name of the god, but in a different form. They called him Rudra instead of Siva. As has been pointed out earlier, it was the fnghtful, demonic aspect of Rudra&rsquo;s character that was specifically stressed in the Vedic literature Tous fact nade bis dame almost a taboo The Vedic poet-priests tried to get over this contingency by referring to that god cuphemistically 171 They gave him the epithet sıra, which in Sansknt meant .grac ons&rsquo;, &lsquo;becevolent 1% Several other Vedic gods also were characterised as fra, but it was only in the case of Rudra that the cpithet becade, in course of time, the proper name of the god It is not unlikely that this happened under the influence of what may be called folk-philology For, the word śng was phoneti cally similar to the name of the proto-Dravidian god (who was the direct ancestor of Vedic Rudra) but which (10 Sansknt) denoted just the opposite of what Rudra generally represented in the Veda. The name Sva as such seems to be unknown to the Sanhitas (ercept perhaps i RV VIL 18 7 where Sıva seems to be the name of a tribe ), the Brāhmanas, and the old Buddhist hterature It is only in the Sretāśvatara-Upanised that the word is first used as a proper gou.

Thus Rudra is not a storm-god as RGB supposes, but re presents just the Vedic version of the proto Indian Sıva-Pasupati It is to this latter god, and not to Vedic Rudra (as RGB says ), that the origin of Saivism is to be traced back Indeed, most of the essential features of Saivism are anticipated by the proto Indian religion of Siva-Pasupati and consequently by the religious complex pertaining to Vedic Rudra 184

The privilege of this favour of Sıva was shared also by Nara who was born of Nārāyana&rsquo;s tapas Nārāyana and Nara, who, in the epoch of the MBh, incarnated themselves as Krsna and Arjuna respectively, continued to enjoy that favour of Siva (Drona 172) A similar explanation was given by Vyāsa in another context While Arjupa was routing the Kaurava forces, he saw that a resplendent person bearing Sūla was actually doing so for him When he reported this to Vyāsa, the latter told him that it was Siva who had been constantly guarding him throughout the war Vyāsa then praised Siva with what is referred to as a caturvidha stotra (Drona 173) 818 Verily, as described in the Aranyaka parvan (38-41), Arjuna had obtained his strongest weapon, namely, the Pasupata-astra, from Sıva himself whom Arjupa had propitiated through tapas and who, in the guise of a Kırāta, had subsequently put to test Arjuna&rsquo;s fortitude and valour &lsquo;18
In the first episode mentioned above, a bint was incidentally given by Vyāsa that Asvatthāman also was in a way cherished by Siva (Drona 172 82) This very point seems to have been further developed in the Sauptika-parvan (6-7) When, after having been temporarily dissuaded from his proposed nocturnal raid, Aśvattbāman returned to his camp, he saw a gigantic apparition blocking bis way He attacked that phantom with all his might, but to no avail He suspected that the phantom was born from his own evil 10clinations, he, therefore surrendered to Śiva, sang him a hymn of praise, and then actually prepared to offer himself as an oblation to the God Śiva was thereby propi tiated He then told Asvatthāman of the rigorous austerities which Krsna had practised for the sake of his favour and declared that no one was more beloved to him than Krsna (Sauptika 7 61 tasmad istatamah krsnăd anyo mama na vidyate)Further, in the same parvan, it is narrated that Yudhisthira asked Krsna how Asvatthāman had, single handed, dared perpetrate the atrocity

doring the night and that Krsza replied that it was all due to the credulous favour of Sira. Krsna further took that opportunity to expatrate on Siva&rsquo;s greatness Brahmā, he continued to tell Yodhisthura, implored Siva to create the world and procreate the boman race Siva agreed and undertook severe penance for that purpose Having waited for the God for a long time, Brahma decided to bring about creation through another agency Siva returned from his penance and san that the world had already been created Greatly enraged, he cut off his generative organ and voleatly planted it upon the earth for, he thought, it was no longer needed Krsna also told Yudhisthira of the sacrifice of the gods in whicb no portion was offered to Siva 3d which, there fore, Sira had rujhlessly exterminated (Sauptika 17-18)
But Sra&rsquo;s unquestioned supremacy is perhaps best illustrated by the Krsna-Upamanyu episode described in the Apusīsana paryan (14-18) Jāmburati desired a son from Krsaa Haying Lnown that Rukmini had given birth to valant sons as the result of Krsna&rsquo;s worstip of Siya, she importuned Krsna again to worship that God for her sale Krsna went to the Himālaya moontam for pedance and casually came to the bermutage of Upamanyu Upamanyu asked Kro3 to practise penance there only, for, Sıra hipself was residing there Upamanya then told Kista bow he bad practised pena gce jn order to propitiate Sna, how he had refased to accept boons from any god other than Sna, and how, in the end, Siva had manifested himself before him and had fulfilled all his desires (14) Krsm too, is then said to have propitiated Siva through penance and to have there by obtained the desired boons (15-16) This narrative is followed by the Śrra-astottarasahasrurāma-stotra (17) and the eulogy of that Stotra by different sages (18) In another context, on hayog beep asked by Yudhisthira shat specific knowledge he had obtained from Dunisas, **Krsta responded by glonfying the supreme greatness of Rudra-Siva (Aouxısana 145) and by explaining the significance of the great god s various n3mes, such

as, Maheśvara, Rudra, Mahadeva, Siva, Sthānu, Pasupati, etc (Anusasana 146 ) It is noteworthy that, in both these cases, a special mention is made of the Satarudrija (Anusasana 145 4, 146 23 )
Various occasions have been manoeuvred by the redactor of the MBh to introduce - appositely or otherwise - hymns of praise of Siva Some of the more important of these Sivastutis are by Krsna in Drona 172, by Vyása in Drona 173, by the gods and the Brahmarsis on the eve of the destruction of Tripura (Kamna 24 ), by Aśvatthāman in Sauptika 7, by Upamanyu in Anušāsana 14, by Krsna in Anušāsana 15, and the Śna-asfotiarasahasra nāma stotra ( Aaušāsana 17) 1 It may also be mentioned that many tirthas spread over different regions of the country are described in the epic as having been sanctified by association with Śiva, in one form or another - a fact that would indicate the wide sphere of the influence of the Siva religion
Attention may now be drawn to some characteristic features of the Sıva religion which become evident from the many allusions to Śiva occurring in the epic In the epic Śiva-religion, greater importance is attached to tapas than to Bhaktı or any other form of worship And this is in full conformity with the proto-Indian character of that religion Whoever seeks to propitiate Siva practises penance-for instance, Nārāyana, Upamanyu, and Kysna did so Even Siva, who is naturally enough represented as the supreme god, himself takes to tapas whenever he wants to accomplish something That phallus worship is an integral part of the Siva-religion is also frequently emphasized in the epic Indeed, Upamanyu argues that Siva is the greatest of the gods because it is only his linga - and of no one else – that is wor shipped by gods (Anušásana 14 100-102 na suśruma yad anyasya lingam ably arcyate surash) The suggestion that linga bere means merely a concrete symbol or an indicatory mark

would not carry conviction For, the symbols of even other gods are seen to be actually worshipped. But it is only in the case of Sıva that his generative organ is worshipped. That linga, in the context of Siva, invariably signifies the generative organ is confirmed by the legend carrated by Krsna to Yudhin sthira regarding Siva having cut off his linga when he discovered that it was no longer needed since the process of creation had already been accomplished (Saoptika 17 24 ) Again, the NB is definitely familiar with the circumstance that Siva is worshipped in two different forms - in the human form and in the form of linga (Drona 173 94 pūjayed rigraham jas tu lingam tā &lsquo;pr samarcajet, also Anusāsana 146 15-17)

The almost unbroken contingity of the Siva-religion from the proto-Indian penod to the epic-paurānic penod is further evidenced, among other things, by Siva appearing as a Kırāta ( Āranyaka 38-41 ) or as a Purusa bearing süla (Droga. 173) and by his being denied a sbare in the sacrifice (Sauptikz. 18, Shoti 274) * Similarly, some of the ideological features of Saivism which were first introduced in the SU are seen to bave been delileated also in the epic - such as, for instance, its Sámkhya-Yoga onentation o13 Supreme godhead of Siva, which is frequently emphasized in the epic, may also be mentioned in this very context. As for this last, however, it needs to be pointed out that, though Nārāyana. Krsna is usually represented as a protege of Siva, the redactor of the epic, presumably with a view to stressing the Vasava genesis of the epic, has introduced some episodes wherein Rudra-Siva u

RGB&rsquo;s treatment of phallus-worship is rather inadequate And this is quite understandable, for, he did not have before him the considerable archaeological material which has become available in recent times the tradition of phallus-worship in India is, indeed, very ancient It has been suggested that the Neolithic people in South India were primarily worshippers of Iinga Evidence is produced in this connection of the Kapagallu hill in Bellary district, where one sees a linga together with a bull in a crouching position 228 Be that as it may, there is certainly far more definite and far more profuse evidence regard ing phallus worship which has been upearthed in the Indus

valey The conical terracotta objects with rounded tops and the ringstones discovered in the Indus valley are, without doubt, the symbols of linga and joni respectively We have already seen that the chief god of the lodus valley people was the 1thyphallıc Yogišvara Pasupati ( who has been depicted on the Mohenjodaro seal and who is identical with the proto-Dravidian god Siva ) 229 The ithyphallicism of the Mohenjodaro figure and the large number of linga-joni-like objects discovered in Indus valley may be presumed to have been closely related to each other-venly, they have to be regarded as denoting the two aspects of the phallic worship which was an integral part of the proto Indian Siva-religion It is not uplikely that the worship of the phallus, which, as evidenced by its almost universal dissemina tion, must have been a naturaf development in the history of human culture, had grown in India independently in the boary past,230 and that it came to be associated with the religion of the shyphallic god only at some later dare Whatever that may have been, one thing seems to be quite certam, namely, that, in the proto-Indian religion of the Indus valley penod, the two had already become organically condected with cach other It is believed that an obloog terracotta sealing discovered in the Indus valley actually shows the figure of Siva with his three symbols, namely, the bull, the tndent, and the phallus 231 We may, therefore, assume that in the proto-Indian Siva-religion the god was worshipped both in the anthropomorphic ithyphallic form and in the form of a separate linga Tus practice of the worship of Siva has continued even in historical times,233 though

the linga-pūjā seems to have become more common in course of time
As pballus-worship was supposed to have been unknown to the Veda, it was suggested that it had originated among the Dravidian races295 or among the Western nations and even among the Greeks 231 For one thing, it is not correct to say that phallus worship was unknown to the Vedic poet-priests, indeed, they knew it and abhorred it as is indicated by their attitude towards the $1śnaderas And, secondly, in view of its universal diffusion in very ancient times, the question regardiog its origin is rendered almost irrelevant 235
There has beeo a tendency among Indian scholars - a ten. dency which is perhaps quite natural - to reject the assumption that the linga is a phallic emblem It is suggested, for instance, that the idea of the Imga originated out of ad attempt to express the inexpressible, to make Siva perceptible to the mental cye 236 The linga is Maheśvara himself, and not merely the emblem of his membrum virile (lingam saksan mahesarah) 217 It was also claimed that the linga signified a protest against idolatry Accordiog to another interpretation, the Siva-linga 1s the closest possible approximation to the cosmic Purusa - the hemispherical top of the linga consists of thousands of heads ( sahasrasirsan), each of the size of a point The linga represents the double idea of the &ldquo;formless&rdquo; and the &ldquo;all-formed” Siva 20

But the more common idea which is presumed to underue the linga is that of the axis mundi (hich is also implied by the Atharvavedic Skambha and the Buddhist stūpa) Recourse is also taken in this condection to the Purídic account of the quarrel for precedence between Brahma and Visou and the appearance before them of Siva in the form of a blazing column the ends of which the two gods were asked to find but which, to their chagrin, they could not. This blazing colamo, it is pointed out, came to be later represented through the linga***
The close relationship between the ithyphallic god and the linga-Joni-bile objects, which is clearly implied in the Indus valley religion should, indeed, put an end to all such speculations

As for the literary evidence in this connection, reference may be made to the description of Rudra-Śıya in the SU as the god, wbo, being one, rules over every single jom (V 2 Jo yonim Jonim adhitisthaty ekah), or as a person who is of the measure of a thumb244 (III 13 angusthamátrah purusah, also V 8), to Upamanyu&rsquo;s unequivocal assertion ( mentioned above) that Siva was the greatest of all gods because it was only his hinga which was worshipped, 245 and to the Purānic account that the sages of the Pine Forest accusing Siva of seducing their wives in disguise, cursed him that, as the result of the curse, the generative organ of Sıva dropped down, and that Śiva, revealing himself to them, taught them, to worship his fallen linga 246 It may, however, be added that, in the Purānas as also elsewhere, we do come across passages wherein attempts are pude to foist some mystic or philosophical meaning on the concept of linga All such attempts have proved to be manifestly artificial and unconvincing We

In connection with the saivism in the Indonesian Archipe lago, a special mention needs to be made of the concept of Bhattāra Guru The concept is evidently the result of the tendency to glorify and deify the Guru or the preceptor In the Saiva tradition, the Guru is believed to be infused with the spirit of $12-1ndeed, he is Sita himself 274 Agastya also plays a significant role in the Indonesian Saivism He is mentioned in the oldest East Javanese tradition ( 760 AD ), and the work entitled Agasty aparia (11th century) refers to Bhakti for Siva
In Cambodia, the medieval princes seem to have been devout worshippers of Sıva For instance, the Han Chey inscription of Bhava varman, who conquered Fu-nan (6th century A, D ), opens with a mangala dedicated to Śiva Similarly, Jayavarman II of the early 9th century AD, is said to have introduced a new type of Tantric ritual for the worship of Devarāja (represented by a Siva linga) who came to be recognised as the tutelary deity of Kambuja from that time onwards 275
In Campā, king Bhadravarman is described in the inscription of the early fifth century AD as having dedicated a temple to Sıva at Mi son under the pame Bhadreśvarasyāmia There is sufficient evidence to show that Siva was worshipped in Campi both in the anthropomorphic and the linga forms Indeed, most of the kings of that country are known to have occupied then selves with the installation and consecration of Siva lingas Reference may also be made here to the Wat Phu hill or the Lingaparvata in Laos where a temple of Śiva had been constructed In Malaysia, on the right bank of the river Bujang, there existed a Pallava type Salva sbrine belonging to the sixth or the seventh century AD Inscriptions on jūpas of the late fourth century

The Vayusamhită speaks of two classes of the Saiva Agamas (1) srauta or Vedic which are of innumerable kinds and (2) syatantra or non-Vedic ( Siddhāpta ) which are of 10 or 18 kinds and are believed to have been composed by Śiva himself The Saiva Āgamas mention twenty-eight Yogācāryas of Saivism, from Sveta to Lakulisa, while Gunaratna enumerates eighteen Acāryas from Lakulīsa to Vidyāguru 2***
Lakulisa, who, according to RGB, was a direct pupil of Srikantha (mentioned in the Mahabharata) and a contemporary of Patañjalı,279 is believed to have composed the Påśupatasūtras (consisting of five adhyājas), and the seventeenth Ācārya, Rasi kara, to have written a commentary on that work known as the Pañcadhyāyībhâsya or the Pancārthabhâsya The Pasupata wor. ship consisted of some abnormal practices hasıla gira-nrita dumdumkāra-namaskāra japa-upahārena upatisthet 280 The Laku lisa-cult spread widely and quickly - Lakulisa himself having come to be regarded as representing the emanated anthropomor phised concept of the potent cosmic role of Śiva81 and several Lakuliba temples having been constructed

The Siva-religion sponsored by the Purīgas is usually known as the Siddhanta-mārga Its principal tenet is Bhakti for Siya, and its ritual practices also are fairly sobet The followers of this school are the ordinary Saixa Bat the name Siddhanta is more commonly given to the Āganic Saiva doctrine of south Todia and sometimes also to what may be called the Vedāntic Saiva doctrine of Kashmir
There is some uncertainty about the schools of Saiyim 10 Kashmir and their literature RGB says that “the Kashmir Saiyism has two branches, the Spanda sastra and the Pratyabhalástra.74 The authorship of the first is attributed to Vasogupta and his pupil Kallata, while the founder of the Pratyabhima school is said to be Somānanda, the author of the Siradrst $ Honeter, in the introduction to his edition of the smadrs, Madhusudan

KAUL SASTRI characterises Somānanda as the follower of the Tryambaka school of the Kashmir Saivism It is pointed out that Siva himself, in the form of Srikantha, imparted this doctrine to Durvāsas who, in his turn, passed it on to Tryambakāditya It was Tryambakāditya, who, in course of time, settled jp Kashmir and formalised these teachings, which later came to be known after him. Somāpanda, the author of the Snadrsti, was the twentieth in the line of teachers from Tryambakāditya It is further suggested that Kashmir Saivism comprises three schools - Tryambaka (which is very much older than the other two), Spanda (which is derived from the Spandasūtra and the Spanda kārıkā ), and Pratyabhijñā which is taught in the Śrvasütras - and is, therefore, called Trika 287 Toçidentally, RGB does not mention the Spandasūira at all, there is also the tradition that the names Spandasūtra aod Spandakarikā denote one and the same work, but Ksemarāja (11th century AD), in his Śnasūtra vimarsini, specifically mentions both the Sutra and the Karikā With Utpala (author of the Tharapratyabhijñākārikā, the Kvara. siddhi, etc), Laksanagupta, and Abhinavagupta (author of the Pratyabhijñāvmarśmi the Tantraloka epitomising the 64 non dualistic Tantras, the Paramarthasāra, etc ), Ksemarāja, who was a pupil and cousin of Abbioavagupta and who wrote, besides the Śnasūtravmaršini, works like the Pratyabhiynahrdaja, the Spanda nirna) a, and the Uddy otas, belonged to a distinguished 110e of teachers of the Kashmir Saivison
It has already been pointed out that Saivism of south India developed in two main directions - of Bhaktı and of Siddhānta The Saiva Sidabāota of the South arose independently and may be said to have supplemented the devotional effusions of the Saiva saints with doctrinal reinforcement It is, for instance, said that in the Tirunāšagam of Mānikka Vasagar (10th-11th century AD) which together with the Tcıāram of the Trio

Besides the Sanskrit Sarva Siddhanta and the Tamil Saiyism there has yet another school of Aganic Saivism in the South, pamely, that of the Viraśarvas or the Lingayatas Actually, the word lingājata does not occur in any extant traditional Sanskrit work on the Virensa religion except the Pirasatrācārapradipikā where it occurs as lingāzita The attempt to explain grammatically the word lingayata as a Sanskrit word is not conyincing 259 It is more ukely that the word is a Kaprada radbhara form of Sanskrit lingurantah** The term Viraana is more extensive and covers both the Arâdbyas (abo continue to adhere to some Brahmanic samskāras aod practices) and the Lingīyatas (who represent a kind of resolt against the Brahmatic orthodots) 21 To the basic

Attention may now be drawn to some distinctive features of Saivism It may be recalled that Vasudevism-Krsnaism Origigated from and centred round a human hero who came to be deified 10 course of time One of the purposes of the Avatāra-theory seems to have been to provide a kind of rationalisation, and also substantiation - for such godship of a buman being Siva, on the other hand, has been conceived as a god from the very beginning And moreover he is conceived essentially as an earthly god - as a god who, being ever present, is intrinsically interested and ja volved in the affairs of man Naturally, therefore, Saivism does pot countenance any Avatāras of Sıva The tradition that, in each Kalpa, Sıva appears along with his four disciples is obviously

Having originated as a religion of the people (rather than of hieratic circles) Saivism has been more or less non confor mist in character in the sense that it generally did not make much of the traditional Varnāśramadharma It also promoted equality of sex Some of the Saiva sects, like the Lingāyatas, even went to the extent of denouncing sedaprāmiānja, Brahma. nic orthodoxy, image-worship, and the doctrine of transmigration
They removed the bar to widow remarriage and strongly protested against child-marriage
There is no doubt that saivism is more ancient than Vaisnayism, but the latter is said to be more expansive, more attractive, and more favourable to community of worship and religious sentiment $10 Both Saivism and Vaisnavism sponsor a personal monotheism (as against the earlier pantheism ), but ritual practices are perhaps more in evidence in Saivism than in Vaisnayısm While Saivism regards the universe as the source of pain and misery - as the pāśa of the pašu - apd, therefore, as worthy of being repudiated, Vaisnavism looks upon it as an evi dence of the lord s omnipotence and, therefore as worthy of being cherished But it may not be valid to assert that, on account of this attitude of Vaisnavismo towards the universe, its contributions to arts and literature have been richer and more profuse than those

dedicated to Visnu Io Campā, an inscription discovered in Duong-Mong mentions the construction of a temple for Visny Purusottama Further, Visnu is depicted in the ananiasāyın posture on a pedestal of a M1-son temple in the region of Maura-Kaman in Borneo, where three jūpa-inscriptions of Mula varman have been found, there was also discovered the figure of a standing four-armed Visnu attached to a pendant Incidentally, Visnu is regarded as a protector god - even as the protector of the faith of the Buddha &ndash;18 Ceylon, and figures in many Ceylonese legends
As for the spread of the Vaisgava tradition in Central Asia, evidence is, first of all, produced of Zenob&rsquo;s story, which, how ever, is of doubtful validity The story speaks of the two Indian princes, Gisane (Kısane) and Demeter, who fled westward with their clan and found shelter with Valarasbak or Valarsaces, the first Arsacıd monarch of Armenia (cn 149–127 B C) It is suggested that Kisane and Demeter stand for Krsna and Baladeva, and that therr flight to Armenia is reminiscent of Krsna&rsquo;s shifting from Mathurā to Dvārakā of real importance, in this context, is the fragment of an inscription in Kharosthi characters, dis covered by A N BERNSHTAM in Tadjikistan, which is deciphered as &ldquo;Nārāyana, be victorious&rdquo; On palaeographical grounds, the inscription is assignable to the second first century BC It is difficult to ascertain whether the reference in the inscription is to the Nārāyana of Vaisnavism or to Nārāyana the Buddha But the proximity of Badarıkāšrapa and Tadjikistan 12 would render it quite probable that the reference is to the Nārāyaṇa of Vaisnavism The Nicolo seal, bearing an inscription in Tocharian script and Tocharian language points to the prevalence, in Central Asia, about 500 AD, of a composite cult of Siya, Visnu, and Surya Definite Vaisnava influence is noticeable in a Buddha image with auspicious symbols from Balawaste in the Domoko region, on the southern silk route of Eastern Turkistan This image is attributable to about the eighth century A D 418

(b) The Sak11-cult The Tantras relate primarily to the worship of Saktı, though other religous sects also have their Tantras It is claimed that the worship of Sakti is a fundamental feature of the Vedic religion and that Vāk, Laksmi, Ida, Kál, and Umā are some of the aspects of Sakti with which the Vedic post-priests were familiar The history of the Sakti-cult is, horever analogous to that of the Siva-cult The Sakti-cult has to be traced back to the pre-Vedic non-Aryan cult of the Mother Goddess On account of the pressure of cusculistances, the Vedic religion was forced to adopt some of the features of the latter in its ideology, but its direct developed form is to be seen in the Sāktism of the epias, the Purānas, and the Tantras In all probability, the Sakti cult originally evolved as an independent religious cult, it must have been only at some later stage that it cane to be affiliated to the Siva-cult, in which latter it found a most suitable soul for growth Actually, as pointed out earlier, in classical Siktiso the active Sakti completely overwhelmed the p355Me Siva Three factors may be said to have helped in the consolidation of the position of Sakti (1) the metaphysically derned concept of the divise energy, (2) the ancient cosmogonial concept of sexual dualism, and (3) the deep-seated primitive faith ia the mother principle as the ultimate secret of the universe It is presumably 19 yies of this that the Tantras are said to have aimed at the simplification of religion on metaphysical rather than on emo tional lines

The later Puranas ( Sth-10th centuries A D ), particularly the Bhavisya and the Samba, are far more important from the point of view of the history of the sun cult They recognise the supremacy of Surya, round whom a full-fledged religious cult bad duly developed Mention is made in the Samba Purana of the Sürya-siddhanta or Aditya-siddhānta, of the Suryabhaktas, and of the special priests of the sun-cult known as the Magas and the Yājakas The association with the sun worship of foreign priests is to be particularly noted $! The Magas from Sakadvipa (East Iran) are said to have been specially invited to officiate at the sun-temple which had been constructed by Samba on the bank of Candrabbāgā (modern Chenab in Panjab) and which was believed to be the first one to be built in India 525 There is historical evidence of the activity of the Magas from the fourth century B C to the twelfth centuty A D 336 It is even suggested that an early form of the sun cult, as found in Kathiawar, may have reached that region as early as the fifth century BC through the Magas when north western India formed a part of the empire of

<p>The Brahmanic religion, in its different phases, can boast of a vast and traditionally continuous literature, which concerns itself, directly or indirectly, with the various aspects of that religion An attempt will be made in this paper to present a connected historical account of this literature, from the age of the Veda down to about the end of the medieval period of course, on account of its decessary limitations, this survey will take into account only the more significant literary works, and, here too, special consideration will be given to such of these works as do not usually receive adequate treatment
Speaking of the literature of Brahmanism, one has to begin with the Veda A mention may, first of all, be made of certain distinctive features of the Veda The term Veda&rsquo; does pot denote any one siogle book-it denotes an entire literature, which is strikingly extensive from the points of view of chronology, geography, and authorship The composition of the various texts which are believed to constitute the Veda has spread over many centuries and over different localities and has to be ascribed to many generations of poets, priests, and philosophers But the ancient tradition in connection with the genesis of the Veda would not warrant the use of such words as composition&rsquo;, authorshp&rsquo;, etc, in respect of it For, it is traditionally claimed that the Veda is apauruseja - that is to say, do human agency is responsible for its creation The Veda has existed from times immemorial, and the activity of the various Rsis (Seers) 10 connection with it is restricted only to seeing&rsquo; or discovering&rsquo; it The claim of apaurusejarva made on behalf of the Veda has naturally given rise to another claim namely of reda prāmänja The Veda, being free from all the limitations and deficiencies usually associated

with human agency, possesses absolute validity in the field of knowledge
The Veda has been transmitted from generation to generation through oral tradition It is called Sruti, because it was recited and beard&rsquo;, and not written and read 2 Though, as suggested above, the Veda signifies not any single specific text but a veri table library of texts, which are remarkably saned in form and content, there is Des ertheless a thread of logical development which runs through it and wbich thus bestows upon it a kind of distinc tire unity The Vedic literary history is usually divided into three main periods, namely, the Samhna-period, the Brāhmand period, and the Upanisad-period Broadly speaking, these periods represent a chronological as well as a logcal sequence Lastly, a reference may be made to another feature of the Veda which is important from the point of view of the literary history It concerns the emergence, 19 course of ume, of various Vedic takhis which have sponsored their own recensions of the different Vedic texts
Before proceeding to a further consideration of the three periods of the Vedic literary history, one may clanfy a few points which have sometimes occasioned a wrong perspective Firstly, it needs to be pointed out that, side by side with the Vedic litera ture, there must have been produced in that age much other litera tore, which, however had cot been consolidated and given a fixed form in its early stages. It also needs to be remembered that not the whole of the literature produced in the Vedic tradition could have been preserved For, the oral transmission has its natural limitations And finally, the Veda can by no means be regarded as the only source of the cultural history of that epoch.
Now to turn to the Vedic Samhitās There are four Sam huas, which are also commonly referred to as the four Vedas pamely, the Rgreda-Samhita, the Atharraveda-Samhitā, the Sama

veda-Samhita, and the Yajurveda-Samhita comprising the Krsna Yajurveda and the Sukla-Yajurveda The name Samhità (collec tion) necessarily presupposes a stage of stray and scattered mantras It may be assumed that the ancient ancestors of the Indo-European speaking peoples once had their common home 10 the North Kirghiz region in course of time, some tribes from among them migrated towards the South east and eventually settled down in the Balkh region There they developed a certain form of their original Indo-European language, which may be characterised as the proto-Aryan language and wbich may be regarded as the direct ancestor of the Vedic language They also developed a form of religion (proto-Aryan), which was, in many respects, a direct precursor of the Vedic religion In course of time there again occurred further migrations from Balkh Some tribes proceeded towards further South east and finally rea. ched Saptasındhu or the land of seven rivers These were the ancestors of the Vedic Aryans 3
The religion of the Vedic Aryans may be said to have been mainly twofold On the one hand, they developed a cosmic religion (10 which such concepts as Dyāvā-Pithivi and Varuna-Rta played the most prominent role), a hero-religion (which was dominated by the personality of Indra ), an Agoi cult, a Soma-cult, etc This was the religious ideology of the classes within the community of the Vedic Aryans Coeval with this there was also the religious ideology of the masses&rsquo;, which was essentially magical 10 character The early Vedic poet-priests and magic priests composed mantras relatiog to both these types of religion The word mantra is, indeed, quite peculiar, for, it denotes, on the one hand, the prayers addressed to the various divinities of the mythological religion of the classes, and, on the other, the formulas and incantations connected with the magical religion of the masses This mantra producing activity presumably started

while the ancestors of the Vedic Aryans had still been in the region of Balkh, and continued during their journey to and early Sojom A Saptasındhu.
The nomadic Vedic Aryans soon settled down in this new region, and there established their tribal dominions A sense of security and prosperity gradually gres among them One thing which they undertook to do in this new phase of their life was to collect, revise, add to, and systematically arrange their stray and scattered mantras relating to both the types of their religion Two great collections of mantras eventually resulted from this activity Broadly speaking, the martras connected with the religious ideo logy of the classes were brought together in one collection, which leter came to be called Rgreda-Samhıtā (or Rgreda), and the mantras connected with the religious ideology of the masses were brought together in another collection, which came to be called Atharraveda-Samhita (or Atharrareda ) Verily, these two alone are the primary Samhilas The æntral theme of the Rgreda may be said to be mythology, and that of the Atharrareda to be magic
The Rgreda-Samhitā which has come down to us belongs to the Sakala Sakhả It consists of 1028 süktas or hymas (includ ung the elesen Valakhilya-hymns) These hymns, which are made op of a varying pumber of mantras in the form of rks or metri cal stanzas, are distributed in ten books called mandalas The formation of the mandalas is governed mainly by the principle of the homogeneity of authorship Among the classes of the Vedic Aryans certain families had already acquired some measure of SOcto-religious importance The mantras or hymns, which the progenitor and the members of any of these families claimed to have seen&rsquo; were collected in the book of that family The nucleus of the Rgyeda is formed of six such family-books, namely, mondulus two to seven, which are respectively 35c7ibed to the families of Grtsamada, Vbvāmitra, Vāmadeva, Ati, Bharadváp, and Vasistha The eighth mandala largely belongs to the Kanvas, while the first mandala represents a collection of what may be called miniature mandalas The Dipth mandala is goseraed by
324
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
the principle not of the homogeneity of authorship but of the homogeneity of subject matter All the sūktas in that mandala relate to Soma The tenth mandala ( which has the same number of hymns as the first mandala, pamely, 191 ) is a kiod of mis cellaneous collection of big and small sūktas Within a family book, the sūklas are arranged according to the subject-matter That is to say, the sūktas are grouped together according to the divinities to whom they relate, and then these Devath-groups are arranged in some set order within a Devatā-group, again, the sūktas are normally arranged in the descending order of the number of their stanzas The other kind of the arrangement of the Rgveda, according to which the whole collection is divided into ,eight astakas, each astaha into eight adhyayas, and each adhjāja into about thirty three vargas consisting of about five stanzas each, is obviously mechanical and is intended to serve the practical purpose of Vedic study
Tradition requires that, before starting the study of any sūkta, one should know four items about it, namely, Rsi (authorship), Devatā (subject matter ), chandas (metre), and viniyoga (ritualistic application) This last item is evidently an after-thought The mandala arrangement of the Rgveda clearly indicates that this Samlıtā is not at all ritual oriented It also becomes clear that the various hymns were not composed with any elaborate sacrificial ritual in view As will be pointed out 10 the sequel, the ritualistic purpose was superimposed on them in &amp; later period
The majority of the suktas in the Rgveda are of the nature of prayers addressed to different dividities usually on the back ground of the description of the various exploits and achievements of those divinities The poets of the Rgveda po doubt show themselves to be conscious artists who not unoften employ various stylistic and thetorical devices But the purpose of these latter is to enhance the magical efficacy rather than the poetic beauty of their mantras Their prayers thereby become compelling invocations to the divinities for the fulfilment of their earnest longings which usually concern a happy, secure, prosperous, domestic life in this

world Apart from such prayers and mythology, we do get in some siktas of the Rgreda intimations of the further develop ment of the Vedic thought in thdoections of ntualism and philosophical speculation. In connection with this Latter, a special mention deserves to be made of the Huranj asarbha-sūkia (X-121 ), the Purusa-szkla (X-90), and the Visadiya-sikta (X-129)
In contrast to the Rgreda, the Atharsareda, which is aptly characterised as the * Veda of the masses&rdquo;, is an essentially heterogeneous collection The mythology of the Rgreda tends to become repetitie, confectional, and stereotyped, while the magic of the Atharrareda manifests itself in ever nester forms The Athartareda is free from all sophistication, its contents do not reflect any inigence of pnestly hierarchy This Veda concerns itself mostly with the every day-ufe of the common man, from the prenatal up to the post-mortem condition - portraying that ufe with all its light and shade, ard hughlighting the generally obscure human emotions and relations Verily, there is an aura of my stery and unetpectedness about it. The interest of the Atharra seda is varied and its impact irresisuble
A distinctive feature of the Atharrareda is the large number of names by which it has been traditionally known. All these names are significant, and together give a full idea of the nature, extent, and contents of this Veda The name Athartăngurasah (an abbreviated form of which, namely Atharraveda, came, la course of time, to be most commonly used) 15 for instance, indicative of the twofold character of the Athar anic magic-the wholesome, auspicious, shite&rsquo; magic of the Atharvans and the terrible, sorcerous, black magic of the Argirases. The substirution of Bhrgu for Athartan in this name (Bhrgrângirasah) is presumably the result of the dominant role played by the family of the Bhrgus 10 a certain penod of India&rsquo;s cultural history. The Poro hita of a Vedic ling, who, with a vien to being able adequately to discharge the daties of his responsible office, <em>2$ etpected to be an adept in white and black magic, naturally depended on the mantras and practices of the dtharsareda, and so this Veda cum
326
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
to be called Purohita-Veda It was called Asaira-Veda, because it included within its scope many practices specifically relatiog to the Ksatriya rulers The Athanaseda consisted of brahmans or magically potent mantras, and was, therefore, called Brahima Veda But the other reason why the Athanaveda is called Brahma-Veda is far more significant On account of the peculiar character of the contents of the Athanaveda, that Veda was, for a long time, regarded as not being on par with the other three Vedas (trayr) As a reaction against this exclusive attitude of the Vedic hierarchy, the Atharvavedins went to the other extreme and claimed that their Veda not only enjoyed, by night, the full status of a Veda, but that it actually comprehended the other three Vedas Already, the view had been independently gaining ground, namely, that the Rgreda, the Yajurveda, and the Sämaleda were essentially limited in their scope and that the brahman alone was truly limitless The sponsors of the Athana veda claimed that this brahman was adequately embodied in their Veda - that the Atharvaveda was Brahma-Veda It is not unlikely that the name Brahma-Veda became stabilised, because the priest of the Atharvaveda in the Vedic ritual was called Brahm. The Atharvaveda is a Veda of magic, and magic becomes effective only through the joint operation of mantras and the correspond ing practices The Atharvareda-Samlıtä itself contains only the mantras, while its various practices are described in its many ancillary texts, particularly in its five kalpas The Atharvaicda 15 accordingly sometimes referred to as the Veda of the five kalpas
Nine (or, sometimes, fifteen) sākhas of the Atharraveda are traditionally known, but the Samıtās of only two säkhās, namely, the Saunaka and the Paippalida, have been preserved It was once believed that the Paippakada sākha was restricted to Kashmir, and the Paippalāda-Samhută was, therefore erroneously called the Kashmiian Athanaveda But it bas now been shown that that sākhā of the Atharvoreda had spread widely also in Eastern Jodia and Gujarat The Saunaka Samhita of the Athanaveda has, however, been more commonly current It consists of 730

hymas (sūktas ), grouped into twenty books or kõndas About five sitths of these sültas ( which are called artha-süktas) contain metrical stanzas, while the remaining säkras ( which are called parjaga-sukras ) contain arasānas or prose-units Unlike the Rgreda-Sanna, the arrangement of the Atharraveda-Samhitā is Dot governed by any consideration of authorshup- it is, indeed, understandable that the histoncal tradition regarding authorship has not been preserved in respect of this Veda of the masses - or of subject matter Agaio, the Atharrareda shows considerable looseness in the matter of metre, accent, and grammar, prestrah ly because, unlike the Rgveda, that Veda was not subjected to any deliberate revision and redaction
The contents of the Atharrateda are remarkably varied 10 character There are in that Veda charms to counteract disease and possession by evil spirits ( bhaisaj)ūni) Indeed, the Atharra veda presents perhaps the most complete account of primitive medicine Then there are prayers for health and long life (ājussani) and for happiness and prosperity (pausnhânı) There are also spells pertaining to the variods kinds of relationship with Fomen (strikarmanı) Hymns which concem themselves with the affaus iny olyog the king (rājalarmanı) and those which are intended for secunog harmony in domestic, social, and political fields (sāmmanasanı) form another significant section of the Atharsareda As for black magis, the Atharrateda abounds in formulas for sorcery and imprecation, for exorcism and counter exorcism (ābhicărikani krtjāpanhararını) One of the most striking features of the Atharraseda may be said to be its polarity, for, side by side with the incantations for sorcery and black magic, this Veda contains bughly theosophic or philosophical speculations which represent a significant landmark in the history of lodian thought
As has been mentioned earlier, the Rgreda and the Atharra Teda are the only two primary Samhurās, the other two Sarhitås being mostly derivative in character Again, it is to be noted 10 this very context that the Sāmaseda and the Yusurreda may be styled as Samurās because they are, in a sense, collections of
328
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISVI
niantras, but in them are reflected tendencies not of the Samta penod but of the Brahmana-penod.
The Sarrateda-Samhità is a collection of mantras prescribed for being chanted at vanous Som3-sacrifices by the Udgått pnest and his assistants, and thus seres an avonedly ritualistic pur pose. Though called Samaredo it is not strictly spealing 2 collection of samans The Sarrateda is essentially 2 dentative production in the sense that most of its rantras are derived from the Rgteda One may imagine three distinct stages in the cro lution of this Veda. Firstly there is some specific mantra from the Rgeda in its original form This n anira is the talen over in the Samneda with a view to its being made the basis of a proper sèman or chant. The only change that is effected in this process concerns the marking of the accents - Dumbers 1, 2, and 3 being now used to indicate the accents instead of the vertical and honzontal tipes as in the Rgreda. In this second stage the mantra is called stīmaj oni-mantra The Samarcd-Samhita is actually a collection of such simaj oninianiras
This collection is made up of two main parts - the Punărcila and the Uttarārcika The Pünārcıha consists of 585 single verses, the first 114 being addressed to Agni the next 352 to Indra, and the last 119 to Soma, while the Uttarārcıka consists of 1225 verses grouped into 400 units of connected verses, mostly treas The total number of mantras in the Samareda, not counting the repeated ones, is 1549, out of which all but 78 are talen from the Rsreda, mostly its cighth and dinth mardalas
It is, however, not in the form in which tbey occur in the Samareda-Samhita that these mantras are cooployed by the Udgātt in connection with the Soma-ritual Toe siimaron-mantras are transformed into chants or ritual melodies, called ganas, by means of such devices as the modifiaton, prolongation, and repetition of the syllables occurrog in the mantra itself and the occasional insertion of additional syllables (stobhas) These sānas, which represent the third and final stage in the cvolution of the Sämareda, Art collected in four bools, amely, the

system Indeed, the Yajurveda may be regarded as the first regular text-book on the Vedic ritual as a whole It deals mainly with the duties of the Adhvaryu priest who is responsible for the actual performance of the various sacrificial rites Incidentally it may be pointed out that, while the Samaveda represents a very early stage in the history of Indian music, the Yajurveda marks the beginning of Sanskrit prose
Tradition speaks variously of 86 or 101 or 100 säkhās of the Yajuneda We may, however, begin with the consideration of its two major recensions, the Krsna-Yajurveda and the Sukla. Yajurveda The difference between these two recensions Iles not so much in their contents as in tbeir arrangement In the Krsna Yajuneda, the mantras (mostly derived from the Rgveda) and the yajus or sacrificial formulas in prose and their ritualistic explana tion (called the brähmana) are mixed up together That is to say, in the matter of form and contents, the Samhitā of the Krsna Yajurveda is not particularly distinguishable from the Brahmana or the Aranjala of that Veda As agajost this, the Samhita of the Sulla-Yajurieda contaids only the mantras and sajus - the corresponding ritualistic explanation and discussion being res erved for the Šatapatha-Brāhmana which belongs to that Veda
From among the many schools of the Krsna-Yajurveda, the Samliitās of only four schools, namely, the Taittiriya, the Katha, the Maitrāyaniya, and the Kapisthala Katha, are today available either wholly or ja fragments The Tarttıriya school, which is traditionally divided into two branches, pamely, the Aukhya and the Khāndikeya, and is further subdivided into five branches, pamely. the Āpastamba, the Baudhāyana, the Satyāsādha. Hiranya kesin, the Bhāradvája, and the Vaikbīnasa 54, has preserved
maintaining the continuity from the Samlıtā period, through the Brāhmana-Aranyaka-Upanı sad periods, up to the Sūtra period It is presumably on account of this fact that the Taittıriya school

is often equated with the whole of the Krsna-Yarneda The name Taittırıya &lsquo;is variously explamed There is, for instance, the legend which narrates how Yājāavalkya, who had developed differences with his teacher Vasampāyana, vomitted the Veda which he had studied from his teacher, how, at the instance of Vanampāyana, his other pupils assuming the form of filtını birds consumed the vomitted Veda, how, consequently, the Veda so recovered by the artırı birds was called the Taittirija-P&rsquo;eda, and how, finally, Yāpavalkya secured from the sun-god another Veda wbich came to be known as the sukla or bright Yajuneda It is also suggested that, on account of the interspersion in it of the mantra and the brähmand, the Krsna-Yajuneda appears variegated
like a attırı bird aod is, therefore, aled Tartırija-Sanhira But the most satisfactory explanation of the name seems to be that an ancient sage called Tittiri was traditionally regarded as the <em>seer&rsquo; of this Veda
As suggested above, the Samhit the Brāhmana, and the Aran yaka of the Taittiriya school form one sipgle unit, and together cover the entire Vedic ntual The Tarija Samhita is divided into 7 händas, 44 prasas (prapūrhakas), 651 anuālas, and 2198 khandikäs The principal sacrifices described in it inclode the New-moon and the Full-moon sacrifices, the Agnistoma, the Vajapeya, the Ripusūya, the Sautrā mani the Agoyadheya, the Agnihotra, the Pasobandha, the Agnicayana, etc These are supplemented by the Tattırīja-Brihrana which deals with the Ašvamedha, the Purusamedha, the Naksatra-Yagas, etc, and the Tairtrija-Arany aka which deals with the Sarvamedha, the Pits medha, the Pravargya, etc It may be observed that, in the Taittiriya texts, neither the different sacrifices nor-the-tantras are given in any rational order It may be pointed qui-that, in view of the peculiar arrangement of these terts, a special method; called the Sārasvata-Patha, which imples the study of the manira and. the brahmana portons together, is adopted in connecpon with them
The other Samhuês of the Krsna-lapun eda agree substantially with the Tarttırija-Samhilā in the matter of contents and arrange.

ment, and even verbally The nucleus of the Katha-Samhita ( which is more commonly known as the Köthaka-Samhitā) is formed of three händas, called Ithimikā, Madhyamikā, and Orimikā Two more kändas are added to this nucleus presumably by way of app endixes - one relating to the japā and the puronuāksă verses to be recited by the Hotr (and the Maitrāvaruna) and the other to the formulas connected with the Asyamedha sacrifice A few striking features of the Kathaka-Samhitā may be mentioned here Firstly, the names of the first and the third kandas of this Samhitā, namely, Ilhimikā and Ormkā, are quite intriguing Secondly, a compa. rative study of the Krsna-Yajurveda and the Suhla-Yajurveda shows that the Kathaka-Samlıtā occupies a position intermediate between the Taittiriya-Samhita and the Vājasaney, Samhitā It may also be noted that the school of the Kathas seems to have been widely current in the days of Patañjalı, as is evidenced by his statement grāme grăme kathakam kālāpakam ca procjale
The Samhita of the Maitrāyaniya school, which latter is closely related to the school of the Manavas, may be said to be more systematic in its arrangement than either the Taittiriya Samhita or the Kathaka-Samutā Its nucleus is made up of three händas, but there is also the fourth kända of the nature of an appendix (khila) and the fifth kanda which constitutes the Mairri. Upanısad The Kapısthala-Katha-Samhitā is available only in a fragmentary and more or less corrupt form Out of its 48 adhyāyas, as many as 19 are lost The text of this Samhită shows but little divergence from that of the Kathala-Samhita
A significant feature of the Suhla-Yajuneda Samhitā, which is also known as the Vājasanezi Samhitā, is that the entire Samhuta and its Bralumana, called the Satapatha-Brahmana, have come down in two distinct versions - the Madhyandına and the Kānva These two versions show essential agreement from the point of view of their contents and arrangement, it is only in the readings of some of the sacrificial formulas and in the orthogra phical peculiarities, such as reading d Occurring between two

vowels as I, that they differ from each other As indicated above, the name Sukla-Yarurreda implies the presentation of mantras (or verses) and sajus (formulas) ID a pure and locd manner by separating them from the brāhmana portion This Samhita is also called Vājasaney 1-Samhita after its traditionally accepted apthor Yamasalkya who is bellesed to base been the son of Vājasen: As another explanation of this name, it is suggested that Yāžavalkya secuted (san) this Veda from the san god who had assumed the form of a horse (rājin) The word rājasoni may even mean the obtaining of food or of strength&rsquo;, which is, after all the principal purpose of a sacrfice
The Văjasanej &ndash;Samhit in the Mádbyandına version consists of 40 adhyājas, 303 anusakas, 1975 Londihas The first 25 adhja fas, which perhaps originally formed the entire Samhita, contain Terses and formulas relating to the principal sacrificial ritual The next 4 adhyājas include additions to these basic verses and formulas Adhjājas 30-39 deal with such sacrifices as the Purusa medha, the Sarvamedba, the Pitrmedha, and the Pravargya, while the last adhjāja constitutes what is popularly known as the Isopanısad The Kansa-Samhita, which also consists of 40 adhyājas, generally follows the same pattern of the distribution of subject matter
Attection may be drama here to some points of special inte rest in connection with the Sulla-} ajurveda-Samhită The sui teenth adhyāja of the Nadhy andina-Sanhıtā, which forms the famous Satarudrija, throws considerable light on the character of the ancient Suva-Rudra religion The thirtieth adhyāja dealing with the Purusamedha is important in that it mentions a number of mixed castes A mantra connected with the Assamedha con tains historically significant allusions to Ambā, Ambikā, and Ambālıkā and also to Subhadrikā of the city of Kampilya in tbe Pancāla country&rsquo; It is also noteworthy that the Vădhyandına Samhita uses the word arrunas and the Kania-Samhita the word

The Samaveda-Samhitā and more particularly the Yajurveda Samhitā already reflect the stage in the evolution of the Brāhmanic religion when that religion had come to be more or less wholly identified with the Vedic sacrificial ritual Sacrifice was then looked upon not merely as a means to an end, but as the end in itself Indeed, sacrifice had almost become the very centre of the life of certain sections of the community The sacrificial system, which had already been rendered highly complex, continued to be made still more complex It was naturally not possible for an ordinary jodividual to master all the increasingly complicated details of the ritual, involving the prakrt-jāgas and the vikrtz jāgas, the obligatory (nitya) sacrifices and the optional (kāmya) sacrifices, and the havis sacrifices and the Soma sacrifices It was consequently inevitable that distinct classes of priests, whose main occupation was to officiate at the various sacrifices in different capacities such as Hotr, Adhvaryu, Udgāts, Brahman, etc, should have arisen in the Vedic society It was also inevitable that these priests should have produced manuals dealing with the different aspects of the theory and practice of sacrifice These manuals are the Brahmanas One claim which is implied in the Brahmanas is that all the mantras in the Rgveda, the Atharvareda, and the other Samhitis are intended to serve an essentially ritualistic purpose, and that the Brahmanas prescribe the maoner in which they are to be made to serve that purpose Accordingly, each of the Brāhmanas is connected with one or the other of the Samhitās
Broadly speaking a Brāhmana text consists of two main parts - the vidhi and the arthavada The vidhi part sets forth the various details relating to a particular sacrifice, such as the proper time and place for a sacrifice, the site of initiation, the priests, the sacred fires, the diginities, the mantras, the oblations, the utensils

and other material, the dalsinā, and the expiation-ntes The corres ponding artharõda glonfies that sacrifice as a whole or a specific nite or detail in that sacrifice by emphasizing its efficaciousness It does so, firstly, by means of ancient legends - most of them having the conflict between the gods and the demons as their central theme They narrate how the gods and the demons were engaged in a battle, how, in the initial stages of that battle, the gods were overpowered by the demons, hor the gods then some how acquired the knowledge of a particular sacrifice or a ritual detail, and how, finally, on account of their hastag performed that sacrifice or having practised that nitual detail, they became power fol enough to vanquish the demons Apother method of glori fying jusufying, or recommending any sacrifice or rite, adopted by the Brālimaras, is etymologising Through an etymologs, which is often fanciful, an item pertaining to the sacrifice is sought to be ensuringly connected with its promised fruit The artharada sometimes lays stress on what is technically called the rupa samrddhi of a 53crificial nite It is often seen that so far as the meamng of a mantra is concerned, the ironira and the ntcal action which is to be accompanied by that mantra hardly have any rational connection with each other it is, indeed, the sound of the mantra, and rot its sense, which actually possesses the ritual istic potence But when, in some cases, even the meaning of a mantra conforms to the ritual action, the mantra becomes, so to
say, doubly efficacious and thereby brings about the rūpasamrdchi of the sacrificial site Bat perhaps the most common device en ployed in the artharāda for confirmiog the efficacy of a sacrificial rite described in the ridhı portion is bandhurā, that is, the esta blusbment of some kind of mystic or magical bond between the various aspects of sacrifice and their desired result. In this connection it needs to be specially pointed out that magic, and not logic, is the main basis of the Vedic sacrificial system
Many Vedic texts are traditionally called Brālmamas, but the more important among them are the Altareja and the Kausirakı belonging to the Rgreda, the Tarttırija belonging to the Krsna Yajurveda, the Satapatha belonging to the Sulla-Yajurvedd, the

Jaiminija and the Tand, a belonging to the Sama eda, and the Gopatha belonging to the Atharvareda The Antares a Brāhmana, which naturally concerns itself mainly with the duties of the priest of the Rgveda, namely the Hoir, is divided into 8 pañcikas of five adhyājas each Clear evidence is available of Pāoini&rsquo;s having known all the forty adhyājas of this Brālmana 11 The first 24 adhyāyas of the Artareya-Brāhmana deal with the hautra of the various Soma sacrifices, the next 6 with the Agnihotra and the duties of the Hotr&rsquo;s assistants, and the last 10, which show signs of being a later addition, with the Pasuyāga and the Rāja. sūya The Kausitakı-Brahmana, also known as the Sanhhāyana Brāhmana, has 30 adhyājas it is a better organized text and covers more or less the entire sacrificial procedure
As has been pointed out elsewhere, the Taittiriya-Brähmana 15 merely a continuation of the Tarttıriya Samhità Its three kändas either supplement the discussion of the ritual in the Samhita or contain a more detailed treatment of some of the topics dealt with in it
The Satapatha-Brāhmana, on the other hand, must be re garded as an independent work which is quite remarkable in many respects Indeed, after the Rgveda and the Atharvaveda, it is perhaps the most important Vedic text from the point of view of both extent and contents The Madhyandına version of the Satapatha-Brāhmana consists of 14 kändas (each Lända haylag a separate name derived from its contents ), 68 prapathakas or 100 adhyāyas ( from which latter the Brāhniana presumably gets its name), 438 brāhmanas, 7624 kandıkās in the Kanya version, the first, the fifth, and the fourteenth Ländas are each divided into two händas, the total number of kāndas in that version thus being 17 Otherwise the names of the kāndas and their contents in the two versions are generally the same The first 9 kändas of the Müdhyandına Satapatha-Brälmana, which seem to repre sent the older portion, fully correspond with the first 18 adhyājas of the Vājasaney-Samhută, and thus cover the basic sacrificial

ritual The tenth kārda, called Agnirahasa, speaks of the my stical significance of the various aspects of the sacred fires, while the eleventh, called As&rsquo;adhyāv recapitulates the entire sacrificial ritual The twelftb kanda is alled Vadhyama, which pane clearly suggests that landas 10–14 constitute a separate ont added later to the original Brahmana This would seem to be confirmed by Patañjali&rsquo;s reference to this Brahmana as Sastipatha&rsquo; - a name presumably derised from the fact that the first 9 händas together consist of 60 adhjāsas The twelfth Lända concerts itself with expiation-ntes and the Sautramani sacrifice The thirteenth Tanda deals mainly with the Assamedha and rather briefly with the Purisimedha and the Sanamedha The first three adhyā) 25 of the last kända of the Sareparha-Brāhmana are devoted to the consideration of the Pravargya, hile the last 6 adhjuājas consti tute the famous Brhadāranjaka-Uparisad
One of the important features of the Sarapatha-Brāhmana is the large number of legends which it contains From among these legends may be specially mentioned those of Manu and the fish, the migration of Vıdegha Māthara from the region of the Sarasyati to the regon of the Sadānīrā ll the rejuvenation of Cyavana,s the romantic affair between Porüraras and Urvas1,16 and the contest between Kadrū and Suparni&rdquo;? Another impor tant feature is that, while some portions of this Brahmana are intimately connected with the Kuru-Paccalas, 1t some others have their provenance in Kosala-Videba 1: This fact clearly indicates that the Salapatha-Brāhmana is a composite work and that its composition must have extended widely m time and space In this connection it is noteworthy that the principal figure in landas 1-5 and 11-15 is Yāzāsalkya, whereas it is sandilya in Ländas 6-10.

The Sāmaveda can boast of the largest number of Brāhmana texts connected with it, but only two or threc of them can be proper ly called Brahmanas - the others being more or less of the nature of Parišistas The Jammıniya-Brälmana, which consists of 1252 sections and which is thus one of the bulkiest of the Vedic texts, constitutes the best source of information regarding the technique of the Sīmagas But it is also a disficult text, since the ritual and the legendary data in it are more or less isolated Another Brahmana which belongs to the Sāmai eda is the Tāndja Brālimana It is also known as the Pañcaviša-Brāhmana, lor, it consists of 25 books Its chief concern is of course the Soma-sacrifice in all its varieties, but its detailed descriptions of the sacrificial sessions (sattras ) organized on the banks of the Drśadrati and the Saras. vati and its treatment of the Vrātya-stomas are also quite interesting Like the Pañcanımía-Brālimana, the Sānaseda also has a Saduimša-Brālmana, the last book of which, called the Adbhuta-Brālimana, deals with omens and portents
The Gopatha Brahmana, which is the only Brahmana of the Athanaveda known to us, is perhaps the youngest of the Brahmana-texts It is also limited in extent, consisting as it does of only two books with 11 prapāthakas The Caranas) üha, which is one of the Parisistas of the Athariaveda, however, says that the Gopatha Brāhmana originally consisted of 100 chapters, out of which only two have survived This is plausible, though not entirely, since many statements whicb are referred to in other texts as being derived from this Brālimana Bre not traceable in the text of that Brāhmana which is available today A significant point about the Gopatha-Brāhmana is that, for the most part, it contains myths, legends, and parables which are intended to illustrate and explain various ceremonies in the Vedic ritual The Atharvanic character of this Brāhmana becomes evident in several ways For instance, it glorifics Angiras as the &lsquo;sage of sages , 30 and empha sizes that a Vedic sacrifice performed without the help of a priest of the Athar aneda is bound to fail 21 Incidentally, Yáska in his

The supposed incongruity between the apparently inconsequen tial and trusial ritualistic details which have been discussed in the Brähnanas and the mock-serious but tediously repetitive manner in which they have been discussed has tended to create the impression that the Brahmanas are after all a twaddle, and, what Is worse, a theological twaddle It, however, needs to be pointed out that what may appear as inconsequential and trial to modern logic could certainly not have been so in the context of ritualistic magic Similarly, the repetitive style of the Brahmanas must have been intended to sene a significant practical porpose, namely, facilitating the oral transmission of those texts The characterisation of the Brāhmanas as twaddle also does injustice to them by neglecting to appreciate adequately their importance from the culture-historical point of vier For instance, from the point of view of the literary history of ancient India, the Brahmanas are important on account of the facts that they represent the earliest attempts to interpret the Vedic mantras, that thes mark the beginnings of Sanskrit prose, that they have presened many ancient legends, and tbat they have in them the seeds of the future development of seseral literary forms and works as also of various branches of knowledge The Brāhmanas contain an exclusive and comprehensive treatment of Vedic sacrificial ritual, and thus constitute hughly authontause sources for one of the most significant periods in the religious history of India. It is again the Brāhmanas which have prepared the back ground for the philosopbical speculations of the Upani sads And, finally, a culture-bustorian can ill afford to lose sight of the various facts of socio-political history which are interspersed in the ntualistic lucubrations of the Brahmaras
The Arcnjalas may be said to have been regarded as inde pendent Vedic texts only by courtesy Actually they represent but a kipd of continuation of the Brāhmanas, tertually as well as conceptualy They mark the transition from the ntualism of the Brāhmanas to the spintoalism of the Upanışads While, on the340

one hand, most of the Aranyaka texts form the concluding portions of some of the Brāhmanas, they have, on the other hand, some of the Upanisad-texts either imbedded 10 or appended to them The Aranjakas seek to present the true mystique of the ritual by glorifying the inner, mental sacrifice as against the external, material sacrifice These tendencies were obviously esoteric and, in a sense, dangerous The study of the Arany akas was, therefore, traditionally restricted to the solitude of forests (aranja) That is why they came to be called Āranjakas It is also not unlikely that this name got confirmed op account of their schematic congection with the forest dweller&rsquo;s stage (Vāna prasthāśrama)
Only a few texts have traditionally come to be called Aranyakas The Altarej a-Aranjaka, belonging to the Rgieda, consists of five books, out of which the second and the third are specifically attributed to Mahidāsa Aitareya and are generally theosophic in their tendencies The first three sections of the second book, which are said to be intended for persons who desire liberation jp gradual stages, teach the prāna-upāsanā The last three sections of that book constitute the Antareya-Upanısad which sets forth Vedāntic doctrines The third book deals with Samhita upāsana and is meant for persons who are still attached to worldly possessions Jo its other parts, this Āransaka treats of such sacrificial ceremonies as the Mahāvrata The Kausitakı-or San khāyana-Aranjaka, which also belongs to the Rgveda, consists of three books - the first two of which are ritualistic in character while the third forms the Kausitaht-Upanisad As for the Tantriya Aranjaka, it is a direct continuation of the Samlıā and the Brāhmana of the Taittiriya school It supplements the treatment of Vedic ritual in the latter two texts by dealing, in its first six books, with such sacrifices as the Sarvamedha, the Pitrmedha, and the Pravargya Its next three books constitute the Taullirija Upa. nisad, while its tenth and last book is known as the Mahānärājana Upanısad The first three adhyāyas of the fourtecoth kända of the Satapatha-Brāhmana are called Arany aha and their subject. matter is the Pravargya The last six adhjajas of that kanda

make up the Brhadāranjaka-Upanisad
The Upanissads may be said to have been the outcome of a strong and deliberate reaction against the priestly exclusiveness and the attitude of blind acceptance engendered by the Brāh manas in the soC10-religious and the intellectual spheres res pectively Free thinking, scepticism, and attitude of inquiry were by no means altogether absent in the earlier periods of Vedic literary history, but they began to become emphatically operative in the atmosphere created by the Brāhmanas The claw of the priests that they alone were entitled to expound the Veda authoritatively, the exclusively ritualistic interpretation which was forced upon the Vedic mantras, the emphasis on the religious efficacy of mechanical sacerdotalism, the elevation of sacrifice almost to the status of the ultimate cosmic principle &mdash; these and similar tendencies which were prominently reflected in the Brāhmanos ane to be challenged by the Upadisadıc thinkers They were not prepared to accept anything on trust - Dot even what was claimed to have been ordained by the Veda They began to ask questions, and it was out of these questions that gedpine philosophical thunking developed The Upanısadıc thiokers also sought to rediscover the spirit of religion which had been smothered by the ercessive insistence of the prests on even the minor detais of the form of religion And, finally, the Upapisadic thinkers helped to bring about a kiod of democratisa tion in the domain of religion and philosophy
The word upanisad 1interpreted variously It is made to correspond with the word upasana which is understood to mean either worship or profound knowledge 23 Or the word upanısad is sometimes interpreted as mysterious wisdom derived through tapas ?! The word is also connected with the Puli word spanisa and is thereby made to mean something like cause or connection

upanuisad as that which destroys (sad = to destroy) ignorance But the sense most commonly assigned to the word upanısad is the esoteric teaching imparted by the teacher to the pupil who sits (sad) near him ( upa) 10 a closed select (1) group The Upanisads are also called Vedānta, because they represent the concluding portion of the apauruseya Veda or Śruti, or the final stage in Vedic instruction, or the ultimate end and aim of the teachings of the Veda
It may be broadly stated that the Samlırās, the Brähnianas, and the Upanisads are the creation respectively of the poet-priests, the ritual priests, and the poet-philosophers One must, however, hasten to add that the Upanisads can be hardly regarded as embodying any sustained philosophical system as such They are neither critical in their approach nor constructive in their treat ment What one finds in them are only the results, without the processes, of speculative activity - only the conclusions without the methodology, of philosophical thinking Logic is usually at a discount, and reliance is mostly placed on intuition or inner voice It was not that the Upanjsadic thinkers abliorred logic, they were only convinced of the inadequacy of logic as an instru ment to tackle the problem of the ultimate reality For them, the ultimate reality was not merely to be intellectually compre hended but it was to be spiritually experienced Accordingly, the Upanısadıc speculations can, at best, claim to be inspired guesses at truth The approach of the Upanisadıc thinkers to the various problems of philosophy is, by and large, mystic vitutional rather than metaphysical-intellectualistie, and their style is characterised by poetic symbolism rather than by logical rigour Verily, the Upansads are the songs before the sunrise
But the importance of the Upanisads as some of the earliest recorded attempts at systematic, ihough not systematised, philo. sophizing can hardly be garasard They constitute one of the most significant sources of the spiritual wisdom of India, and are traditionally regarded as one of the three prasthānas of Indian philosophy Also one cannot fail to be impressed by certain notable features of the Upanış ads, such as the unity of their pur

pose in spite of the variety of the doctrines, the note of certainty or definiteness which informs them, and the various levels at which they consider and represent reality
Not much need be said about the Upanisads in the context of religious literature as such, because they concern themselves with the contemplative-realizational rather than with the ritua listic-ceremonial aspect of the spuntual life of the people. In other words, they may be broadly said to belong to the realm of philosopiy rather than to that of religion, though in the 2ncent Iodian ideology it is by no means easy to damarcate between religion and philosophy Over 200 tests call themselves Upani sads, but they include such recent works as the Christopanısad and the Allopanısad The Junikopanised gies a traditional ust of 108 Upanisads (10 belonging to the Rgreda, 19 to the Sukla Yajurveda, 42 to the Krsna-ların eda, 16 to the Såmaseda, and 31 to the Atharrareda ), but, even out of these, many texts are called Upani sads only by courtesy Usually 13 Upanısads are regarded as the principal Upanisads They are traditionally con Dected with one Vedic sâkhā or another, and several of them actually form part of a larger literary complet

The Prašna-Upanı sad, the Mfunda (or Mundaka )-Upanisad, and the Mānduk ya-Upanisad belong to the Athariaveda As its name suggests, the Prasna Upanısad deals, in its six sections, with the sux questions (praśnas) relatiog to such topics as the nature of the ultimate cause, the significance of Om, and the relation between the Supreme and the world The name Munda is suggestive of renunciation, and, in its three chapters, this Upa nisad discusses samnyāsa and parā vidjā as against samsára and aparā vidyā Incidentally, the national motto of India, saljam eva jajate, is taken from this Upanısad (II! 1 6) The Mfandūkja-Upanı sad is a very small text consisting of only twelve stanzas, but it has attained a significant place in the philosophical literature of India on account of the fact that Gaudapıda, tradı. tionally believed to have been Sankara&rsquo;s teacher s teacher, prote, by way of a commentary on this Upanisad, his famous Kārkās which may be said to contain the first systematic statement of the doctrine of absolute monism The Tarttırija Upanisad is a part of the larger literature complex of the Taittiriya school of the Krsna-Yajurveda As pointed out in an earlier context, books 7-9 of the Taittirija- Āranjala constitute the Taustırija-Upani sad, while its tenth and last book is known as the Mahânārajana Upanisad The Tautarija-Upanısad is divided soto three sections called jallis-the Siksā vall, the Brahmananda-ralli, and the Bhrgu vall. The Aufarej a-Upanisad of the Rgieda is equivalent to Aitareya-Aranjaka II 4-6
By far the most important of the Upanisads are the Chando gja agd the Brhadaranyaka The Chăndogja-Brahmana belonging to the Kauthuma-sakhă of the Sámaveda consists of ten chapters The first two chapters, which comprise the Mantra-Brāhmana, deal with ritualistic subjects, while the last eight chapters con stitute the Chandogja Upanisad The first two of the cight

prarăthalos of the Chårdog a-Upanisad may be said to be Brahmanic tendency They treat of the various names of
unce, as also of udgitha and prarara Another subject with which they deal is the three @stamas The other prapithalas of the Chandog a-Upanisad are distinctively philosopbucal in character Some of the topics 10 this Uponisad of particular philosophical interest are the sandılja ndjá, ibe samsarga ridjā, the paiStārata-radyo, and the teachings imparted by Praāpati to Indra, by Ghora Angrasa to Korda Deviliputra, by Uddalaka Ārudi to Svetaketu, and by Sanatku mára to Mārada The Brlidāranj aha-l fanssad wbuch belongs to the Sula-racurreda, is the biggest and perhaps the oldest of the Upanisads In the Madhyandına recension this Upanisad corresponds with chapters 4-8 of the fourteenth handa and chapter 6 of the tenth handa of the Solapatha-Brahmarg of the same recension The Kanya Brlodāranj al a-l parisad (which, incidentally, Satlara has chosen for his commentary) is analogous to the last six chapters of the sixteenth kõnda of the Kānya Satapatha-Brāhmana There is, however, no material divergence between the two recensions so far as the subject matter is concerned. The first two chapters of the Brhadaranjaka Upanisad constitote the madhu-landa, the main purpose of which 15 to establish the bas c identity of Jiva and Brahman The next two chapters, which seem to form the kernel of this Upanısad and which make up what is known as the jajFaralkza-kānda or the mun-kanda, are domipated by the personality and the teachings of the greatest of the Upadisadic pbilosophers, Yáña Valkya The Khula-hānda, shuch consists of the last two chapters, deals with various kinds of upásanās It is not unlikely that these three hardas onginally formed three independent Upansadic texts It may, indeed, even be that the Brhodárenjala Upanisad represents a fusion of many shorter Upanısads
The three other Uparısads which are usually added to the traditionally recogaized dosa upanısadah (mentioned above) to make up the thirteen principal Upanisads are the Sretānatara and the Jauri or Jaitrāj ani (both of which belong to the Krsna.

Yajuricda) and the kausitaki (which belongs to the Rgveda ) The Svetāśvatara-Upanisad, which consists of six chapters and 113 stanzas, is essentially a theistic text It presents the Supreme Brahman as the Personal God Rudra and teaches the doctrine of bhakt This Upanisad is also remarkable for its use of the Samkhya terminology and its attempt at reconciling different religious and philosophical views which were currently in vogue 25 The Maitri- or Maitrājani Upanisad consists of seven chapters, the last two of which are comparatively late It mentions the Trimurti concept, and, 10 its references to the illusory character of the world and the momentariness of phenomena, seems to betray the influence of Buddhistic thought The Kausilaki-Upa. ni sad, though also called Kausitakı-Brāhmana Upami sad, is not connected with the kausitaki (or Sankhāyana )-Brāhmana As we have already seen, this Upanı sad is the third chapter of the Sankha. Jana Ārany aka It deals, among other topics, with the progres sive definition of the Brahman, the course to Bralımaloka, and Indra as life and immortality
Apart from these principal Upanisads, there are many other Upanısads which are essentially sectarian in character and pseudo philosophical in contents They are usually divided, in accor dance with their main tendencies, into various classes such as Sāmānya-Vedānta, Yoga, Samnyāsa, Saiva, Varsnava, and Śūkta
As for the age of the principal Upanısads, they may be rougbly said to extend over a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BC, the older ones among them being decidedly pre Buddhistic So far as the relative chronology of the Upanisads is concerned, it is customary to speak of the four classes, namely, ancient prose, early metrical, later prose and later metrical However, instead of relying on such external criteria, it would be more reasonable to assume that the Upanisads - particularly the larger ones - were composite works, and then to stratify them as Brahmanic, Brahmano Upanisadic, Upanısadıc, and neo Upa.

Disadic according to the tendencies most prominently reflected in their different parts
The Upanısads an, no doubt, be said to represent the high watermark of Vedic thought, but it also needs to be realised that certain features of their teachings proved detrimental to the influence of those teachings becoming permanent and widely prevalent For one thing, the Brahmoudy of the Upanisads was too subtle to be adequately comprehended by ordinary people. It demanded high intellectual level and strict spintual descipline on the part of the seeker Again, the absence of any unified doctage in the L panısads tended to confound the common man rather than offer him proper guidance in his spiritual quest The fact that the aim of the Upadisadıc philosophy was essentially individualistic - that the L padisa dic philosophy lacked any larger social appeal- also proved to be, in a sense, its seal point The Upanisads gave to the people a &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo;, but not a religion&rsquo;, wbich latter alone could have met their spirtual Deed The cumulative result of all this was that the end of the penod of the major Upanisads say the gradual dwindling of the influence of the Vedic tradition Four cultural movements emerged during the ensu ing interregnum Firstly the heterodor religions like Buddhism and Jainism began to assert themselves Secondly, as a natural reaction to this challenge to orthodor Brahmanism, attempts were made to consolidate the Vedic way of life and thought by reorganising and systematizing all Vedic loonledge and Vedic practice The Sutra-l&rsquo;edānga Literature was the outcome of these attempts Thirdly, for the purpose of counteracting the renunciatory tendencies generally encouraged by the Upantsads, there grew what may be called secular and materialistic ten dencies such as were best manifested in a work like the Kauning Arthaśāstra And finally, there evolved Hinduism hich steered clear of the heterodory of Buddhism and Jainism on the one band and the revivalism of the $dira-&lsquo;edānga movement on the other Hinduism was a kind of federation of tribal religious cults, most of u bich were ongnally non-Vedic in provenance and hich tended to converge in the course of histoncal development - this

federation being held together by means of the thin thread of formal allegiance to the Veda For our present purpose, we are concerned only with the literature relating to the second and the fourth movements
As we have seen, the Brālimanas, the Aranj ahas, and the Upanısads, are believed to be opauruseja Not so the Vedāngas, which represent an attempt at systematizing the various aspects of ancillary Vedic knowledge These Vedāngas are Śrsa (plonetics), Kalpa (socio-religious practice), Vjākarana (grammar), Nirukta (etymology, exegesis, and mythology), Chandas ( metrics), and Jyotisa ( astronomy) Each of these șix Vedāngas is connected, in one way or another, with the Vedic religion, although it is only the haipa which may be said to be directly religious in purpose By the Kalpasūtra is usually understood a whole literary corpus com prising the Srautasūtra, the Gujasūtra, and the Dharmasūtra, which, broadly speaking, refer respectively to the religious, the domestic, and the social aspects of the life of the people These sútras primarily seek to regulate and codify the practices which were already in vogue, but, at the same time, they also initiate new practices or modify the old ones in accordance with the times, the climes, and the school traditions in which they originated
&lsquo;There is reason to believe that each Vedic school produced its own Kalpasūtra, though, quite understandably, not all these texts are available today The nature of a Kalpasūtra will be clear from the following analysis of the contents of the Kalpasūtra of the Apastamba school of the Taittiriya sakhā of the Krsna. Yajurieda This kalpasītra consists of 30 praśnas (chapters ), the first 23 of vluch constitute the Srautasūtra The 24th praśna is called the paribhasā prasa and contajas the pariblāså or the general rules and definitions connected with the ritual In view of its character as introduction, this prasna should have beco placed at the very beginning of the Kalpastītra, but, as the commentator Kapardısvāmin explains, this parıbläsa is applicable to both the Srautasülra and the Grljasūtra and is, therefore, placed between these two The paribhäsi praśna also comprises the pravara and the Nautra The 25th and the 26th prasnas give the
LITERATURE OF BRAAVANSU
349
mantras to be employed for the various grhy a rites, while the 27th prašna makes up the pastamba-Grhy asūtra proper The 28th and the 29th prasnas contain the Dharmasüfra, acd the 30th prasna is the Sulbasūtra To these 30 prasnas is sometimes added the 31st prasra constituting the Putriren a sütra Among other soch complete Kalpasūtras which are avadable today, may be mentioned those belonging to the Baudhāyana, the Hiranyaloin, and the Vaikbanasa schools of the Tasttiriya salhă All these texts are called Sutras because they h3ye adopted the unique literary form which was developed dunng this period samely, the Sūtra-form. The sūtra is an apboz tic statement - at once brief, Daequivocal, comprehensive, gecerally valid, and expressive of the essential point Presumabk, the sūtras were originally intended to sene as lecture-notes for the teachers of the various schools
The Srautasūtres, as has been mentio ed above, contain injunctions regardiog religious practice, which latter, however, 15 understood in the restricted sense of ntualistic practice Natu rally, therefore, they are directly connected witb the Brahmanas, particularly with their ridlu-portions. But the Srautasūtras present the procedure of the various sacrifices (several of which are not at all described in the Brahmanas) 10 a far more completc and systematic manner - these Surras haviog been presumably composed as practical aids to the profe«sional officiating priests Closely related to the Srautasūtras are the Sulbasūtras which deal with such matters as the construction of the Jajñasála, the mea surements of the different kinds of fire-allars, etc
The Srautasütras generally treat of sacrifices in which the three sacred fires, the Āhararija, the Garhapatja, and the Dalsina, (or sometimes more) are employed These sacrifices usually require the services of several officuting priests such as the Adhvaryu, the Hot, the Brahman and the Udgāts, and their assistants According to the traditional enumeration, the stuuta $acrifices include the seven harirajñas.imsthās (namely Agnya
dheya, Agnihotra, Darsapürnamāsa, Igraj ana, Căturmisja, Airudhapasibandia, and Sautrāmani) and the seven somaj ajña samsthās (damely, Agnistoma, Athagnistoma, Ththya, Sodasın,350

Vājapeya, Atırätra, and Aptoryāma) The frauta sacrifices are classified in another way, namely, as istis of which the Darsa pūrnmāsa is the norm, the animal sacrifices of which the Nirūdha paśubandha is the norm, and the Soma sacrifices of which the Agnistoma is the norm
The majority of the Srautasutras which are known today belong to the Hajureda (particularly to the Krsna-Yajurveda) This is quite understandable, for, the Adhvaryu plays the most active role in the frauta ritual, and the Yajuneda is essentially the Veda for the Adhvaryu The Baudhājana Srautasülra belongs to the Taittırīya sak ha of the Krsna-} ajurveda, and is perhaps the oldest among the Srautasūtras Indeed, Baudhayana is traditi onally regarded as the foremost among the Acāryas The Baudrāyana-Srautasülra is called a praiacana, and is written more in the style of the Brāhmanas than of the Sūtras Special mention may be made of the two sections included in this Sitra, namely, the Dardha and the Karmānta, the former critically records the viens on ritualistic practice of the various Ācāryas of the Taittıriya sällä The other Srautasūtras which belong to the Taittiriya sākhã are the Bharadiāja, the Āpastamba, the Satza. sādha-Hıranjałeśin, the Vaikhānasa, and the Vādhūla 26 The Bhäradıāja Srautasītra consists of 15 prašnas, the paitrmedhiha Sūtra, and the parise sa-sūtra It does not give any hautra at all The Apastamba Srautasūtra is the best known of the Srautasütras A Haufraparısista ascribed to Āpastamba is also available There is considerable similarity between the Āpastamba-Srautasūtra and the Satjāsådha lliranjakesı Srautasütra so far as their ritual is concerned A poteworthy feature of the Park hānasa Srautasutra is that, unlike the other Srautasūtras belongiog to the Yajuneda (which begin with the description of the Darśapürnamāsa), it begins with the Agnyādheja which is followed by the Agnihotra homa The text of the Vadhula Šraulasītra, which has become available, is corrupt and fragmentary Out of the two Srauta

practice, called Paddhatis and Prayogas, have been produced by the differeat Vedic schools These are, of course, of a much later date
The Grhy astītras deal with the household ceremonies or grhy a rites which broadly comprise the seven pākaj ajñasamsthas (namely Aupasanahoma, Vaisiadera, Parana Astakā, Māsi fräddha, Sarpabals, and Bānabalı) and also the rites connected with the various samskäras or sacraments Some rites, like the Agravana, the Aadlıuparla, and the obsequies, are common to both the Srautastra and the Grhjasūtra The Grhiyasītras have very little to do with the Brāhmanas, but they are directly connected with the Samhıtās since they derive their mantras from them it, however, needs to be pointed out that not all the mantras prescribed to be employed in the grhja rites are traceable to the Samutās The grhy a rites are generally performed with the help of only one fire, in many of these rites the services of officiating priests are not required, and Soma has no place in any of them when they form part of a corpus the Grhyasūtra presupposes and occurs after the Srautasūtra It is, however, difficult to say whether the Šrautasūtra and the Grhyasutra belonging to the same school can be ascribed to the same author ship At the same time, one does come across many verbal repetitions in the two Sutras of the same school
Like the Srautasülras, the Grhy asūtras also show, to a certain extent, the influence of the specific Vedic schools to which they belong The Sanhhājana Golijasūtra, which belongs to the Sankhāyana school of the Rgieda and which is based on the Baskala recension of that Veda consists of six chapters, the last two of which are presumably later additions The name of the author of this Grhyasūtra is said to be Suyajña Śankhiyana The Kausitaka Grhyasūtra, which is attributed to Sambavya, has five chapters and is almost a replica of the original Sänk häjana. Grhjasūtra But perhaps the most important Grhy asūtra belong ing to the Rgveda is the Assalajana-Griyasūtra It consists of fout chapters and its author is traditionally believed to be Saunaka&rsquo;s pupil Asyalāyana A few other unpublished Grhyasūtras of the

of the two Grhresūtras of the Sul la-Yajurseda, oce, namely, the Paraskora-Grly asāra (which is also knomn as the Ratira Grhjasiira or the l&rsquo;ājasarea-Grhy asūtra ) u poblished, wbile the other, namely, the Banjarāpa-Grhy asuira, is known only through references to it in other works The Paraskara-Grhyasūtra 15 connected with the Madbyandıra sākta The largest domber of the published Gratūras belong to the Rosma-Taurredo The Baudhārare-Gri asutra ( consisting of four pracros), the Bharad naja-Grhy asūtra (consisting of three profnas) the Apastambo Grhy asūtra (consisting of three pravas, out of wluch tro give only the mantras for grhya nites while the third comprises the injurctions regarding the performance of these sites ), and the Satfisādha-Hiranyales-Grlijasūtra (also consisting of two prafras) are included in the Kalpasūtra-curposes of the respec tie Vedic schools The Voil harasa-Grhy asuira, shich also belongs to the Tasttıriya sāk kā of the Krsna-Tajurveda, presopposes (like the Apostamba-Grhasitra) a collection of montras to which 1t refers only by pratīkas The Agnisessa-Grhy asüfra 18 ascribed to Agonca who is said to have founded the Āgan esya school which forms a subdivision of the Vádhūla school of the Taittiriya säkhā Howerer, in the matter of both style and content, this Grhy arira differs substaotially from the other Grhasūtras of the Krsno-1 ajurveda It appears to have been largely influenced by the religious practices of a comparately hate date The Maitrā yani Sahā of the Krena-) ajurveda has two Griyasūtras, pamely, the Mānara-Grhjasūfra and the Vārāka-Grhy asūtra The Jūrato Grhasūtra is divided into two main sections called purusas Among the top es which seem to be peculiar to this Griyasutra may be mentioned the worship of four Vidāyak2s, the Sasthikalpa, the Vratacar and $3rdhya, add the several dilsis The l&rsquo;arāka Grhy asüfra bas quite a large number of sufras common with the Jānara-Grhy asutra and the Kathaka-Grhyasūtre This latter Grhy asutra belongs to the Kathala salhi of the Krsna Yajurveda, and is, on account of its five principal parts, known as

From among the Giljasūtras belonging to the Sāmaseda, the Gobhila-Grhy asūtra presupposes, besides the Samaeda-Samhitā, a collection of mantras known as the Mantra-Brāhmana. It seems that the Grhijasūtra and the Mantra-Brāhmana were compo sed side by side and in accordance with a common plan The Khădıra-Grhijasūtra, which is almost identical with the Dráhya yana-Grhyasūtra-Vrit, is presumably an abridgement of the Gobhila-Grhy asūtra The Jaimma-Grhyasūtra, which is divided into pūriam (24 Alandas) and uttarain (9 khandas ), seems to presuppose the Jaiminija-Samhita of the Sāmajeda The so called Kauthtima-Grhja of the Samayeda is a corrupt text show og signs of lateness Two other Grliyasūtras of the Sāmaseda, Damely, the Gautama and the Chándogja, are not published but are referred to in other texts The Kausika-Sutra, which belongs to the Saunaka sākha of the Atharray cda, is traditionally regarded as the Grhyasūtra of that Veda But apart from the grhja mites this Süfra deals with the various magical practices of the Athana veda It is suggested that the Kausiha Sūtra represents a mixture of two separate Sūtras, namely, the Atharia Sūtra and the Grhya
Sūtra
Compared to the Srautasūtras and the Grhyasūtras, the Dharmasūtras which have become available till now are very few in number It may, however, be pointed out that, besides the Dharmasūtra texts, which have been published so far, many other texts belonging to this category have become known through quotations from them in other works It is also possible to presume that some Dharnasūtras are now completely lost There is another significant point about the Dharmasūtras Though the different Dharmasatras are traditionally believed to have been affiliated to different Vedic schools, the influence on them of these specific schools is almost negligible It seems that, while the Sraula and the grlja practices varied-at least in some details - from school to school, social practices, civil and criminal law, and polity which constituted the principal subject matter of the Dharmastitras, had become generally common to the entire Vedic

Aryan community Understandably enough, therefore, the connection between a Dharmrasüfra and any particular Vedic school was often tepuous Witbun a Kalpa-corpos, the Dharma Sūtra usually follows the Grhy asūtra It may also be noted that many topics, such as the asramadharmas, are common to the Grhy arītra and the Dharrasītra The arrangement of the sobxect-matter in the Dharmasüfras annot be said to be at all orderly, but, in the light of the classification of topics in some of the later metrial Smrtis, it is possible to classify the topics in the Dharrasītras also under three main beads, namely, ācāra, parahira (bich includes rājad.arma ), 2nd prājascita. As for the literary form of the Dharmasútras it may be mentioned that, with the exception of the Gautama-Dharmasútra and the Vallha rosa-Dharmashtra, they contain sūtras interspersed with metrical passages
Only six texts, which may be characterised as Dharmasītras, have been published so far Perhaps the best known among them is the Gautamo-Dharmashtra Presumably it is also the earliest. The Gautcma-Dharmasūtra, which consists of 28 chapters, belongs to the Sõnareda Though there is nothing specifically sāmavedic about this Sūtra, it may be noted that its entire twenty-seth chapter is taken from the Samaridiāne-Brol.mona of the Samoreda
Three facts, namely, that the word jarara occurs in thus Sūtra, that the only teacher of Dharmasastra mentioned by name in it is Mand, and that Gautama as a teacher of Dharma is referred to in the Bavdhājara-Dharmasūtra, are usually adduced m connection with the date of the Gautama-Dharn.asūtra But these facts aan hardly be regarded as constitutiog any conclusive evidence, either singly or cumulatively The Baudrājana-Dharmashtra, which contains four pranas, forms part of the Baudhājana-Kalpasitra It is, however, doubtful whether Baudhayana is personally the author of this Sufra, for he is referred to in the Sufra in the third person and as Bhagavān Baudhyana, The 28th and the 29th prasnas of the pastamba-Kalpasūtra form the Dharn sart of that school There are many indications to show that the Grhrashtra apd the Dharmrasūtra of the Apestämba school, are

from the same hand The so-called Sarjāsādha-Hiranyake$i Dharmasūtra ( which corresponds to the 26th and the 27th prasnas of the Satyasadha-Kalpasutra) is almost identical with the Apa stamba-Dharmasüfra This fact would suggest that the Satya sādha-Hiranyakeśın school did bot originally have any Dharma sutra of its own, but that, in order to complete its Kalpa-corpus, it adopted the Dharmasūtra of the Āpastamba school as its own Dharmasutra
Tbe Vasistha-Dharmasūtra, in its most common version, has 30 chapters, out of which the first twenty-three form the original part of the Sūtra wbile the last seven āre a later addition in its present form this Dharmasūtra is full of repetitions and even inconsistencies Vasistha, who is presumably the author of this Sūtra, is referred to as an authority on Dharma in the Asanusmrti and the Yājñiavalkjasmrti, but bis relationship with the Rgvedic seer of that name is uncertain The Vaikhānasa-Dharmasūtrd, which is made up of praśnas 8-10 of the Vaikhanasa-Smārlasūtra, deals, more or less exclusively, with the varnásramadharmas It is closely related to the Manusmrti, but it does not have any sections on rājadharnia and śāddha It is customary to include the Visnusmrti, which is also called Visnu-Dharmaśāstra in the colophons of some of its manuscripts, among the Dharmasutras The Visnusmrti consists of 100 chapters, and, as its name suggests, it claims divine authorship Many of its verses are found also in the Manusmrtı It is suggested that this work originally belonged to the Kathaka sākha of the Krsna-Yajurieda and was later redacted by a Vaistava author Actually, however, it seems to be a loose compendium on Dharmaśāstra, produced in the period of transition from the Dharmasūtras to metrical Smrtis
Broadly speaking, the Dharmaśāstras or metrical Smrns re present a later stage 10 the evolution of the literature on Dharma Sastra than the Dharmasūtras But it cannot be assumed on this account that every Smrt had a Dharnasūtra for its basis or that exery Dluumasutra gave rise, 15 course of time, io a metrical Smrit This point received special relevance in connection with the problem relating to the Manuısmrt, and the Mānara Dharmasūtra It

was suggested that the present Janusmrti was a metrical redaction of the Manara-Dharmasutra which belonged to the Maitrāyani Salka of the Krsna-Yajurveda But no Vānasa-Dharmasūtra has become actually available so far Nor is it esen mentioned a any other work. Various arguments have, therefore, been advanced to prove that a Mänava-Dharmasūtra must have once cxisted, but that it must have been lost in course of time There have also been counter-arguments to disprove the existence of a Järava-Dharmasürra However after a critical consideration of these arguments and counter-arguments, one is inclined to con. clude that aeither of them are conclusive enough, and that, there fore, thus question will have to be regarded as an open question
By and large, the entire Vedic literature - whether apauru seja or paurusega - may be said to be directly religious in charac ter As against this, the post-Vedic Sanskrit Literature is by 10 means homogeneous from the point of view of either form or contents Religion 15 but one of the many fields which this Literature covers -though, one may perhaps hasten to add, there 15 hardly any ancient or medieval Sansknt text, even among those belonging to the avowedly secular type, which is not religion oriented in one sense or another Another point may be noted here We have dealt with the Vedic literature in a more or less regular chronoloncal order The logical and chronological sequence which characterises the various Vedic periods, 15, however, absent in the post-Vedic Sanskrit literary periods Ve have, therefore, to consider the post-Yedic Sansknt religious texts, not chronologically but 10 groups formed in accordance with their contents and tecdencies

various incarnations ), superseded the Vedic gods like Indra and Varuna The doctrine of Bhaktı or devotion to a Personal God began to prevail, and the different religious practices associated with it, such as pūjā, replaced the Vedic saçtıficial ritual The ideal of social solidarity (lokasamgraha) was given as much importance as the Upanisadıc self realisation (ārmajñāna) Consequently, Karmayoga came to be encouraged as against Samnyāsa The response of Hinduism to the external and internal challenges was one of gradual assimilation and adaptation rather than of opposition and isolation, and the tendency to synthesise various religious practices and philosophical doctrines into a single harmonious way of life and thought became prominent A mention may be made also of the new polity and statecraft which came to be sponsored
The influence of some of these trends in Hinduism becomes evident even in the ancillary texts of the different Vedic schools, like the Parisistas, the Prayogas, and the Paddhalıs, which, of course, belong to a fairly late date The Vaikhanasa-Sūtras, for instance, which claim to belong to a school of the Yajurveda, are actually related to a Vaşnava sect in South India Similarly, the Baudhājana Grlyaparısıstasūtra deals with some aspects of Visnu-pājā Such texts, though ostensibly Vedic, have taken over many of the non-Vedic beliefs and practices
But the characteristics of Hinduism, which have been set forth above, are best reflected in the Bhagavadgitā, which may, indeed, be regarded as the principal scripture of this new religious ideology,33 as also in the character of Krsna as portrayed in India&rsquo;s great epic Mahābhārata The Alahābhārata is, in many Seoses, a unique literary phenomenon It is by far the biggest single literary work known to man The vastness of its extent is aptly matched by the encyclopaedic nature of its contents and the universality of its appeal The claim is traditionally made, and fully justified, that &lsquo;in matters pertaining to dharma (relie gion and ethics ), artha (material progress and prosperity },

kama (enjoyment of the pleasures of personal and social life), and noksa ( spiritual emancipation), whatever is found in this epic may be found elsewhere, but what is not found in it it will be impossible to find anywhere else. The Vahābhārata, as we know it today, is the outcome of a long process of addition, assimila tion, exposion, revision, and redaction Presumably, it ongna cated as a bardic-historical poem, called Joya, having the eventful Bhārata-war as its central theme in course of time, a large amount of material belonging to the uterary tradition of the Sītas, which had been developing side by side with the montra tradition embodied in the Vedic literature, came to be added to the histonaal poem, thereby transforming it into the epic Bharato But this transformation of the Jaja into the Bharata recensed added momentum from another and, from our point of vier, more significant factor, namely, the rise of Krscaite Hinduism. The protagonists of this religion realised that the bardic poem,
bich had been enjoying Wide carteDC), would serve as the most eficient vehicle for the propagation of their ideology They, therefore, redacted that poem in such a way that the Bhagavadgitā became the cornerstone of the new epic superstructure with Krsoa as its central character Upon thus new literary product, called Blārata, which had dermed its bardic-histoncal elements from the ancient Sūla-tradition and its religio-ethical elements from Krsnaite Hinduism, there came to be gradually superimposed elements derived from the Brahmagic learning and culture as also from the other aspects of Hinduism The result was that the Bharata became the Jahabharata It is, indeed, on account of the contributions of Krtcaism, Brabrcanum, and the larger Hinduism that the Fotābhārala has become a veritable treasure-house of religious beliefs and practices
The Vahabharata, which must have assumed its present form doring the first centuries before and after Christ, is traditionally believed to consist of 100,000 stanzas divided into 18 partans Some of its typical religious sections are the Süryanarrāsta

śataka (Āranyakaparvan ), the Sanatsujātija (Udyogaparvan ), the Bhagavadgita and the Vasudevastuti (Bhismoaparvan ), the Satarudrija (Dronaparvan), the Jāpakopākhyāna, the Nārāyaniya, and the Uñchairtly upākhyāna (Santiparvan), the Snasahasra. nāmastotra, the Gangāstava, and the Vis usahasranāmastotra (Anušāsanaparvan), and the Isvarastutt and the Amugitā (ĀŠva medhikaparvan) A mention may be made in this context also of the Harivainsa, which is traditionally regarded as a Ahilaparvan of the great epic
If the Mahabharata (with the Harnamsa) glorifies the Krsna incarnation, the other epic, the Ramājana, gives an account of the Rāma incarnation This incarnation is traditionally believed to have been earlier than the Krsna-incarnation, but the composition of the Rāmāyana, which is largely the work of a siogle poet aamed Vālmīkı, seems to have begun after that of the Mahābhārata and to have been completed before the Mahābhārata had assumed its final form The Ayodhyā episode in the Rama yapa probably has some historical basis But, with the exile of Rāma, the theme of the poem is enlarged to epic proportions, and the prioce of Ayodhyā becomes transformed into the leader of the Aryan expansion to the South and eventually into an incarnation of the highest god Cleverly interwoven with these two strands is a third strand, namely, that of an agricultural myth Compared with the Mahābhārata, the Ramayana presents a more voitary structure, not being too much overloaded with extraneous Sautic material, it is also distinguished by several features of classical Sanskrit poetry The Ramayana consists of seven kändas the entire seventh kända being evidently a later interpolation It contains several sections of religious significance, such as the Sürya stava ( also called Aditya hrdaya) by Agastya and the Råmastuti by Brahmā (both in the Yuddhakānda) Its principal religious appeal, however, springs from the idealısed domestic and social virtues which its characters embody Indeed, this appeal has proved to be more direct and sustained through the centuries
The Puranas, as texts, are chronologically much later than the two epics - the final redaction of even the earlier ones

among them having been accomplished not before the age of the Guptas But, from the point of view of the major part of their subject-matter, they belong to the ancient literary tradı tion of the Sūtas, which is also fcown as the itibāsa-purana tradition. It is customary to divide the infasa-furora Litera ture into three broad classes, namely, māsa or epic history (represented by the Mahabharata ), Larya or epic poetry (re presented by the Rārājara), and purana or epic legends (represented by the Purānas) A Purana is traditionally defined as comprisidg five main topics, pamely, sargo (creation), prali sarga ( dissolution and re-creation ), romsa (diyine genealogies), maryantara ( ages of Manus), and ramsyān.canta (genealogies of kings. It would be seen from this definition that the Purēnas, in their onginal form, had very little to do with religious beliefs and practices as such But code of the Puranas as we know them today strictly adheres to the definition of five topics mentio ned above (parcalal sana), actually these topics do not cover toore than one forureth portion of the estact Purana Nor does any Purāna strictly adhere even to the definition of ten topics (dasalaksana) which are made up by adding five more topics, camely, vrtu ( means of livelihood), ral si (10camatiods of gods ), men (final emancipation), retu (hving beings) and apăsraya (Brahman) It is the subjects shich came to be incorporated into the Puranas in the course of their growth, such as those relating to religious instruction, sectarian cults, ritual, dāna, vrata, Tirtha, srčddna, bhaka yoga, aratēra etc., which have given them their truly religious character and have thereby confirmed their claim to be the Veda of the common people.

One may refer here also to some other works, which are significant from the religious point of view The Brhatsamhıtā of Varāhamshira ( 550 A D ), though a work on astronomy and astrology, is almost encyclopaedic in scope, and contains much material of a religious character, such as details of private and public worship, temple architecture, iconography, and works of charity The Adliyātma-Ramājana (15th century), which is a part of the Brahmanda Purana, is usually treated as an indepen dent work An attempt is made in this work to superimpose monistic Vedānta on the doctrine of devotion to Rāma The more important among the manuals dealing with Bhakti are the Bhaktı-Sutras of Nárada (10th century), the Bhaktı-Sutras of Sandilya (earlier than the 10ch century), the Bhakti-Rainavalı (1400 A D ), which is an anthology compiled by Visnupuri of passages from the Bhagavata-Purāna relating to Bhakti, and the Bhaktardhini of Vallabha Several imitations of the Bhagavad.

The Dharmasastras or Smris are religious in character and purport more or less to the same ettent as the Dharmastras They may be said to bile presened the traditional rules governing man&rsquo;s persocal, domestic, and social behaviour Easıly the best known work of this type is the Varusmrti The Vammrti or the Bhrguaritā, which seems to have belonged to the penod when the Valābhārata was undergoing its final redaction, consists of twelve chapters It begins with a statement regarding the process of creation, and then proceeds to lay down, 19 the nest five chapters, the rules of conduct for persons belongog to the different social orders ( rarras) and the different stages of life (āsamas ) It then goes on to discuss the duties of lugs (rajadharma) where, in connection with the admjaustration of justice, it deals at some length with the 18 titles of law It ends with the mention of some erpatory ntes (prājaścittas ) and a de sultory discussion of a few philosophical topics like karma, gunas, etc The other Smrlis mostly follow the patter of the rarnasama dharma as laid down in the Jarusnirti It is only in the matter of Jatakāra (cy and criminal law ) that these lan-books appear to differ from one another For instance, the Yājrarak jasiritt, which belongs to the 4th-5th centuries A D and which is divided into three clear-cut sections, namely, acara (religious Law), rjasahāra (av ard criminal lan ), and pray ascitia (erpua tion), puts greater stress upon prate lan than opon criminal law and shows great advance over the Varusini 10 the law of inheritance An interesting work of the nature of a Digest of Law is the Caturrargacintärrani of Hemadr ( 1260-1309 A.

relating to the various Hindu systems of philosophy - usually considered in its three principal classes, namely, the Sūtras, expository works on the Sütros, and independent treatises - Day be said to have developed almost independently of what is normally understood as religion That literature is also quite extensive It may, therefore, be left out of this survey of religious literature The ethico didactic literature in Sanskrit (as also not a little of the poetical and dramatic literature) may be characteri sed as religious so far as its theme and ultimate purpose are concerned However, for obvious reasons, this literature too cannot be dealt with here But due potice must needs be taken of the two types of literature in Sanskrit, which are distinctively religious in character, namely, the Tantras and the Stotras
Tantra is a generic term denoting the literature of certain religious cults which seem to have begun to become prominent witliin Hinduism (and, for that matter also within Buddhism) from 500 A D onwards This literature did not necessarily arise to oppose the Vedas which claimed some kind of formal authority in respect of Hinduism It only averred that, while the Vedas were all right for the earlier ages, their doctrines and practices had lost their appeal 10 the Kaliyuga The Tantras, therefore, took the place of the Vedas as the authoritative religious literature of the new age In a sense, the Tantras claimed to do with reference to Brahmanic Hinduism what Brahmanic Hinduism had done with reference to Vedism Paradoxically, however, while the Taniras, on the one hand, sought to democratise Hinduism by removiog the barriers of sex and caste ro the matter of religion, on the other hand, they laid down strict rules regarding the initiation of the sõdhakas into their secret doctrines and practices
Tantra is fancifully defined in the kāmikāgama as follows
fanoti vipulān arthän tathamantrasamāśrutan/
frānam ca kurute jasmat tantram ity abhidhijate // The Tantras comprise esoteric teachings and mystic-magical practices of various kinds Their dogma and ethics are more or less similar to those of Brahmanic Hioduism But their distractive

feature is their religious practices which include mantra (magi cally potent formula ), bija (mystical letter or syllable which forms an essential element of the mantra), Jantra ( mystical diagram), nyasa (mental appropriatod or assignment of various parts of the body to tutelary derties ), mudrå (particular positions or inter twinings of the fingers ), mandala ( mystical diagram without bija ketters ), jāga ( sacrifice ), Joga (meditation ), upasarā (worshup). pētra ( going on a pilgrimage ), etc The Taniras also deal with the various details of pājā apd orgastic rites as also of tetaple architecture and iconography Many of the late sectarian Upani sads, which have been referred to abose, are of the nature of Tantras, similarly the influence of the Terras on some of the Puranas quite unmistakable A Tarira-text, whose authorship is usually anonymous, normally consists of four parts or padas which deal respectively with ridja or jñāra (soteriological theo logy), I nijā (practices of the cult), carjā (personal and social behaviour), and yoga (psychophysiological discipline ) Unlike the Veda the Tantras, whose number 15 indeed, large, are empha tically sectanan in character They relate mainly to the three sects - Saiva, Vaisnava, and Säkta - and the tantric texts belonging to these sects are respectively called Āgamas, Samhıtās, and Tantras It is generally believed that the Agamas originated in Kashmir, the Samhitas in various parts of India, particularly Bengal and South India and the Tartras in Bengal and Eastern and North-Eastern India
In the Sabdalalpadruma the follosing definition, again fanc ful, of Agama is gisen:

matam ca rāsuderasja tasmad āgamam ucjate ll There are 28 Saiva Āgarrias which are traditionally telieved to bave originated from the five mouths of Siva - five, pamely, Kamila, Yogaja, Cmija, Kārana, and Anna, from the sadyojata mouth, five, namely, Dipta, Salsma, Sahasra, amsumar, and Suprabheda, from the rāmadera mouth, five, namely, Vijaya, Misräsa, Srirambhura, a nala, and Vira from the aghora mouth, five, namely, Raurara, Afaluta, Vimala, Cardrajrana, and Bimba,

from the fatpurusa mouth, and eight, namely, Prodgita, Lalita, Siddha, Santana, Sarıohta, Paramešvara, Airana, and Vatula, from the isāna mouth As many as 207 Upāgamas are also mentioned Further, there exists, by the side of the basic Āgamas, an abun dant literature pertaining to the Saiva ritual produced by such teachers as Aghorasivācārya and Somasambhu The epoch of the redaction of the Agamas is uncertain, but they have been profusely used by Tirumular and other Tamil writers and must have accordingly belonged to a period not later than the seventh century AD These texts have been carefully presened in the families of Gurukkals who use them 10 connection with their religious rites The tradition of temple architecture and icono graphy as taught in the Saiva Agamas is still living A reference may also be made to the deep influence which these Āgamas are seen to have exercised in the ancient kingdoms of South-East Asia
The principal Tantric Vaisnava cult is known as Pancarātra The name Pañcarásra is variously interpreted,38 but it seems best to understand it as alluding to the five nights during which five discourses were given by Nārāyana respectively to Siva, Brahmā, Indra, the Rsis, and Brhaspati Traditionally, 108 Samhitās of the Pāñcarātra are mentioned, though their number is sometimes given as 215 or even 290 The entire corpus of the Páscarātra literature is believed to consist of 11/2 crores of verses Among the Pāñcaratra Samutās, which are variously referred to as Elāyana-Veda or Mula Veda or Müla Sruti or Pancama-Veda or Malopanısad, some are specially honoured For instance, the Satriata., the Pauskara-, and the Jayākhya Sanitās are said to constitute the Ratnatraji (jewel triad) But on account of ils being the first to have received a critical treatment in modern times the Ahurbudlya-Samlıă has perhaps become better known This Samutã is believed to have been produced in Kashmir 10 carly fifth century AD It devotes its major part to the dis cussion of kry and carsi rather than to viāna and yoge in Sac

section, however, it presents an interesting survey of vanous systems of religion and philosophy The Ratnatrazi mentioned above is presumably older tban the Alırbudium a-Samhitā - the Sättrata-Samhitā being perhaps the oldest (3rd century) Among the other well-known Sanhitās are the Israra (which is perhaps One of the earlier ones produced in South India and which is quoted by Rámānuja&rsquo;s teacher Yāmuda), the Parama (bich, together with the Pauslara, es quoted by Rāmánuja ), the Brhad. brhama ( which is beliesed to belong to that is koonn as Mārada Parcarātra and which contains prophesies regarding Rāmānuja and most therefore be later than the 12th century), the rang mrtesāra ( which also belongs to the Nārada-Picarátra and wbuch contains the glonfiction of Kosnu and Rādha and is thus close to the Vallabha-system), the Kāsj apa, the Pārameara, and the Lalsi
Side by side with the Paparātra, there also developed the Tantric Vaisnava cult known as Vaikhāna sa The Vaisnava temples in South India, and to a certain extent, in Ransthan and Orissa, are governed either by the Pancarātra canons or by the Vaikhānasa canons For instance, the religious rites at the Varadaraja temple at Kanchi and the Sriranganātha temple at Srirangam are performed according to the Pãöcarātra, while those at the Venkateswara temple at Tirupati are performed according to the Vaikhānasa (though, curiously enough, at the temple of Venkatarara&rsquo;s consort Padmívati the rites are performed accord ing to the Patcarátra) Similarly, some specific Samhras are regarded as authontative at specific temples, as, for fastance, the Pauskara and the Pāramesrara at the Sriranganātha temple the Jajākhye and the Pādre at the Varadaraja temple, and the Sālirata and the Thara at Melkote- though the Padma-Samhita is seen generally to govern the Vaisdava pijā
Though the Silta Tantras are traditionally believed to exist in three groups of 61 terts each, their actunt number as known from several manuscript-catalogues, is very much larger
The chronology of the Tantras is difficult to determine, but it may be pointed out that there are codications of the influence of the
368
INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
Tantras even in the Mahābhārata and that some elements of the Tantras have been epigraphically documented since 424 A D The more important of the Tantras have originated in the Kaula school The Mahānınana-Tantra, which is perhaps only next to the Bhagavadgitâ in popularity, is a late work (18th century) presumably produced in Bengal It may be regarded as present ung the Sākta doctrine and practices in the most representative manner The Brabman is identified with Saktı, the ultimate principle having to be necessarily female Among other topics dealt with in this Tantra are pañcataliya, pañca-malara, cakra püja,*9 symbolic meditation on Sakti, etc Its metaphysics is not different from the Sankhya and the Vedānta, and its dharma ( social ethics) seems to have been adopted from the Manu smirti
The Kulārnava-Tantra speaks of six forms of acāra, but emphasizes that moksa is possible only through the acăra as ordained by kula It also insists that the five maloras must not be employed except in strictly esoteric circles From among the other Tantras may be mentioned the Tantrarāja (which, in its first part, deals with the Sriyantra), the Kulacūdā mani (which serves as a popular manual on Tantric ritual), the Prapancasāra (which discusses the essence of universe&rsquo;), the Jānārnava ( which regards humārīpājana as the highest sacrifice ). the Saradanlaka (which expounds the esoteric significance of mantras and ; antras ), the Yogini ( which includes the māhāimya of the Kāmākhyā temple), and the Gandharia (which speaks of idols) Some of the other important sākta texts are the Sricakra sambhāra, the Kāmakalāvläsa, the Advaitabhāvopanısad and the Satcakra nırīpana A mention may be made in this context also of the Deilmalämja ( 6th century), which is included in the Märkandeja-purāna, in which Devi is glorified as the eternal Universal Mother, and the commentary on wbich, called Dašinga, gives a detailed description of the Sikta pājā, the Devi-Bhagavata.

Purāra (1100 A.D ), which is a sākta counterpart of the Vaisnava Bhāgorata-Purāna, and the Adbhuta-Rāmāyana, which is obviously a late work and in which the Saku-cult is sought to be introduced into Vaisnavism by elevating Sith over Rāma
The Stotra-literature in Sanskrit is very rast Indeed, one wonders whether any proper count has ever been made or can be made of the works belonging to this class This literature must also be said to enjoy the widest currency among the people The tradition of prayers and hymns in India is quite ancient and may be traced back to the Rgreda Stotras bave been included in the epics, the Purānas and the Tantras Some epic poems also contain fine specimens of hymaal poetry, such as, for instance, the hymn to Visnu (Raghuramsa X), to Brahmi (Rumāra. sambhara III ), to Mahadeva (Kırātārrun ja, closing canto), to Krsna (Sisupalaradha XIV), and to Candi (Haravijaja XLVII). In a sense, the Nard-verses in Sanskrit dramas may also be regarded as religious lyrics But the targer part of the Stotra literature seems to have been produced independently Apart from single works of more or less definite authorship, many collections of Stotras - a large cumber of these Stotras being of anonymous authorship - are available in priat, such as, for instance, the Brhaistotramuktahāra, the two Brhatstotraratråloras, and some of the Gucchakas of the Kārjamā la
The major Stotras usually relate to the five Hinda diyinities namely, Ganapatı, Sürya, Siva Sakti, and Visau - Siva perhaps being most commonly praised and prayed to Then there are Staras addressed to the ten incarnations of Vista, either indi vidually or collectively A substantial cumber of Stotras are agam addressed to what may be called localised disinities, like Venkatesa of Tirupati, Mināksī of Madura Vivanātha of Vara. nası, and Srirangapatha of Srirangam Minor divinities like Sasthi Sitala, and Manasā, rivers, and holy places also bave their share of Stotras Stotras possess a twofold appeal, religious and literary, but it may be added that barning a few noteworthy erceptions, the majority of Stotras are known for their religious appeal rather than for their lyricism And even this religious370
INSIGHTS INTO HINDVISM
appeal is characterised by a conventionalised idiom rather than by a genuine effusion of religious emotion
One of the early Stotras is attributed to Bāna ( 7th century) It is the Candidataka which consists of 102 verses, mostly in the sragdharā metre, in praise of Mahisāsuranardini The Surya. Sataka by Bāna&rsquo;s contemporary and close relative Mayūra has, however, received a greater approbation from literary critics Traditionally, the great Sankarācārya is said to bave composed nearly 200 Stotras, out of which at least some like the Ananda lahari (consisting of 20 sikharini verses ), the Saundary alahari (containing 103 Sikharını verses - the last verse being in the vasanta tilakā – in praise of Saktı), the Mohamudgara (also known as the Dvadasapañjarikā), the Bhaja Govindam (also known as the Carpatapanjari), the Harimide, and the Slāparādha-K&rsquo;samāpana may be said to betray the touch of the master In most of these, devotional fervour is very well matched by poetic elegance, and deep nysticism by musical rhythm The Pancasari describes the plıysical charms of Kápáksi in erotic terms, and is ascribed to poet Mūka who is believed to have been a contemporary of Sankara The Styamahimnahstotra ascribed to Puspadanta (9th century ?) is perhaps more philosophical than religious in its tenor, and can boast of over 20 commentaries To almost the same period belongs the Devisataka of Anandavardhana ( 850 A D ), which seems to have been planned rather as an essay in alamhāras than as a religious hymn A reference may be made here also to the hymnal literature produced by other Kashmirian poets, such as the Slavacintamani of Bhatta Nārāyana (8th century), the Snastofrāsali of Utpaladeva (10th century), the Bhavopahāra of Cakrapaninātha (11th century ?), and the Ardha. nāristarastotra of Kalbana (12th century) The Samba pañcāsıkā, which is a hymn to the sun god and which is traditionally attri buted to Kssna&rsquo;s son Simba, is also probably the work of a Kashmirian poet
Coming down from Kashmir to Kerala one may mention the Mukundamālā of Kulasekhara ( 11th century ?), which is a small work consisting of about 30 verses (the number of verses varies

three characters - Krsna, Radhā, and her companion - on the background of the rāsakrida in Vrndāvana Its central theme is that rāsa, the realisation of blissful personal communion with the Lord, is the final goal of all religious activity, and this theme is vivified by Jayadeva through his masterly exploitation of the media of poetry, nusic, and gesture dance (abhinaya) The Gitagovinda, which is variously characterised as a lyric drama or a pastoral or an opera or a melodrama or a järra, consists of 12 cantos, each canto containing padávalis or songs set to different rāgas These songs are introduced by one or two metrical stanzas which seem to have been intended to be sung in chorus The great popula rity of the Gitagovında is vouched for by its several imitations In some of these Rāma and Sitā or Sıva and Parvati take the place of Krsna and Rādha The Singararasamandana by Vallabhā. cārya&rsquo;s son Vitthaleśvara ( 15th century) contains songs modelled on Jayadeva&rsquo;s compositions Another work, namely, the Krsnali lūtarangini by Nārāyanatirtba (1700 A D ), also contains devotional lyrics set to different rägas But the truly glorious period of Sanskrit religious poetry-or, for that matter, of Sanskrit poetry in general - must be said to have ended with Jayadeva bimself

<p>It was once generally believed that, in the matter of spintual culture, South India was largely - If not exclusively-undebted to the North. A critical study of the cultural history of ancieat Iodia would, however, show that the advent of the Aryans in this country and their subsequent victorious progress altimately resulted not so much in the Aganisation of India as in the Indiadisation of the Aryans Let the illustrate this point with reference to religion. Broadly speakiog, the religion of the Aryans, which is popularly known as Brahmadiso or Vedic religion, developed mainly through three distinct stages - the cosmic-heroic worship of the RgTeda-Samhurā, the complex ntua lism of the Brāhmaner, and the mystic idealism of the Upanisads Obrously, such a religon, particularly in the form which it bad assumed in the age of the early Upanisads, mas not likely to satisfy the religious urge of the people at Large Though, there fore, its first Ausb, this hieratic Brahmanism seemed to dominate the religious scene of Northern India, its unidence soon began to wane The penod immediately following the prigcipal Upanısads, accordingly, saw the rise of new religious beliefs and practices Actually, these beliefs and practices were by no means new They had already been in eustence in this courtry to a Tesser or greater extent. But, 111 course of time, they ane to be suppressed by the religious ideology of the victorious Aryans Indeed, it is this latter ideology which must be characterized as Des and exotic As I bare said, the Vedic religion overwhelmed the earlier religions, but only temporanly Lo the post-Upanısadıc period, several pre-Vedic non-Aryan religious movements began to make their influence felt. Such were, for instance, the move ments which later consolidated themselves in the form of Buddhism and Jainis. The attitude of these two religions was asowedly acti-Vedic For my present purpose, I Deed not dilate upon their future history I may only say that it completely belied their

early promise One of them disappeared, almost entirely, from the land of its birth, while the other persisted but with a very restricted currency
It is still another religious movement, which also, in a sense, arose by way of a reaction against the hieratic Brahman ism, that is relevant to our purpose The sponsors of that movement must be said to have taken an essentially practical and realistic view of things they realised that the gods of the official Vedic pantheon, like Varuna and Indra, the very compli cated system of Brahmanic sacrifice, and the highly esoteric teachings of the Upanisads bad almost ceased to appeal to the popular imagination, and that, therefore, people were again turning back to the various pre-Vedic religious cults They also realised that the Veda still contipued to have a sufficiently strong hold on certain influential classes, and that an anti-Vedic attitude, by itself, did not generally find favour with the people They, therefore, sought to bring together, under a common fold, the various popular cults, which were non-Vedic, but not necessarily anti-Vedic, in origin and character, and which, despite the preva lence of Brahmanism among certain sections, still commanded large following among the masses But, while doing so, they took care to see that this new popular religion did not divorce itself completely from the Veda On the contrary, this new religion openly accepted allegiance to the Veda And though, in actual practice, this allegiance proved to be just nomipal, it definitely served to hold together the many, originally unrelated, popular cults This is how popular Hinduism, which symbolises the rel gious culture of the majority of Indians even today, originated In course of time, even the staunch votaries of Brahmanism, who were making a last bid to save their Vedic heritage against the opslaught of the anti-Vedic crusaders saw in the rise of Hinduism a welcome opportunity to preserve at least some vestiges of it If, however, one compared Brahmanism and Hinduism, one would find (dat, ra the mythology and religious practices of the latter, there were more indigenous Indian elements than the Vedic odes And not a few of these were derived from South India

Perhaps the greatest gift of South India to Hinduism is god Siva The primare religion of South India may be described as a form of shamanism, in which the simple folk indulged in ecstatic religious practices and sought to propitiate their god mamly with the offerings of blood Presumably, on account of sich offerings of blood, this god came to be alled Sma, ich word in proto-Draydian meant red&rsquo; Apart from the rude icons reddened with blood, this god of the proto-Dravidians seems to have been represented also through two other symbols, namely, the linga or the phallus and the bull There is, indeed, ample evidence to show that, long before the adient of the Aryans, the cult of this popular proto-Indian god had spread far and wide in this country- different aspects of his religion being specially emphasized in different regops He was, for instance, celebrated as Sia in South India and as Pasupati to the lados Valley as Bhava by the Bāhikas and as Sarra by the Easterners
Some of the religious practices associated with Sua fete obviously such as clearly offended the susceptibilities of the hieratic poet-prests of the Veda. At the same time, the popular pressure in favour of sna mas so great that those poet-priests could not belp making room for that god in their pantheon. The Vedic Rudra represents, both 10 pace and character, a brahma Dised version of the proto-Indian Siya. Naturally enough, Rudra 1$ seen to have been deliberately isolated in the Vedic mythology acd ntual. But, with the rise of popolar Hindaism, this recalci trance was completely overcome, and Siva&ndash;his con-Aryan name now beug understood in its Aryan sense of benevolebt&rsquo;, but most of the other traits of bis ongial character and cult being presented intact - came to be conceded a very prominent place among the Hindu gods As a natural consequence of this, several religious practices associated with the cult of Siva, soch as pūja, balı, and joga, which, incidentally, Fere essentially non-Vedic in origin and character, came to be introduced into Hinduism, and Hindu mythology care to be enriched by many a legend celebrat 10g Sisa and his other ancillary disznities.
The brahminixation of South lodia may be said to have

begun round about 1000 B C and to have been completed before the times of Asoka Surely, it was this historical process which gave rise to the cycle of Agastya legends in Hindu mythology Even Tamil literature has its own traditions about Agastya According to one such tradition, a large number of gods and sages had assembled in the Himalayas to attend the wedding of Siva and Pārvati The sheer weight of this august assembly caused the earth to sink down towards the north, thereby jeopardising all creation At that juncture, the gods and the sages hit upon the idea of sending Agastya to the South in order to restore the disturbed balance of the earth Before Agastya proceeded on this mission of deliverance, he went to the river Ganga and obtained from her the river Kāveri He also married Lopāmudrā, and secured Jamadagor&rsquo;s son, Trnadhūmāgni, as his pupil He further persuaded eighteen members of the Vrsni family of Dvārakā and eighteen crores of Vēlır and Aruvālar to accompany him to the South With this large following, he came down to the Vindhyas, cut down the forests, set up, with the help of Kāyeri, extensive colonies in what was originally a wilderness, and finally made his own home in the hill of Podiyil in the southern part of the Western Ghats Another tradition makes Agastyas pupil Trnadhūmigo, who had in the mean time assumed the name of Tolkappiyar, the author of the oldest Tamil grammar Tolkoppiyam Still another tradition speaks of Agastya&rsquo;s having been the Kulaguru of the first Pandya ruler, who, inci dentally, claimed to be the descendant of Sıva All these Tamil traditions evidently confirm and supplement the history underly ing the epic legends
The so-called Aryanisation of South India was in several respects quite unlike the Aryanisation of North India Firstly, this movement was of the nature of Hinduisation rather than of Aryanisation For, the most tangible result of it was the accep tance by the South Indians pot of Vedic theology but of Hindu BOCYDOBY as refecitá m The caste system Seconäry, this movement does not seem to have evoked much opposition on the contrary, there is evideoce to show that the changes wrought by it were

Welcomed by the Dravidians with alacrity And, thirdly, the incursions from the North were not so violent as to root out the languages and the peculiar religious culture of the South. Indeed, this contact between the North and the South involved much give and take - perhaps more gise than &ldquo;take on the side of the Dravidians For instance, the suddha bhakn or the way of unmixed personal desotion to God is believed to have been the special contribution of South India to Indian religious thought. According to the Padmapurana, bhalni originated in the Dravida country, passed from there into the Maratha country, and finally reached the Gangetic doab round Mathurā The therarams and the prabandhams of the Tamil saints, read with the Bhāgavata purāna, which latter speaks of the very large number of bhakras 10 the Dravida country, would also seem to confirm this tradition Four gods are specifically menuioned 12 this connection, namely, the “ red one with blue throat” or Siva, the &ldquo;white one of the ploughshare and the palmyra flag” or Baladeva, the blue one with the eagle flag&rdquo; or Krsoa, and &ldquo;the rider on the elephant With the peacock-fag&rdquo; or Subrahmanya The manner in which these gods are referred to by Nakkirār in his poem suggests their having been regarded as peculiarly Tamil gods
Co-existence was the watchx ord of the religious life of the hinduised South India. Vedic ritual was practised side by side with the elaborate pūjā of the Hindu gods, and even the Buddhists and the Jaipas freely followed their religious practices But the religion, which could be characterised as specifically South Indian, concerned the village-gods of those people in spite of the influences from the North - whether Brabmanıc or Hindu - more than eighty per cent of the population continued to worship their primitise local divities in every village in South India may be seen, even today, a shrine or a syobol of its own gräma-derată, who is propitiated, periodically and with communal worship, in order to avert pestilence, famine, or any other calamity befalling man or animal This religion does not boast of any syster of phulosophy as its foundation, por of any vniform ritual as its superstructure But it certainly has its own mythology. A major

part of this mythology is preserved in the form of confused legends by the families of Asādıs, and revolves round the origin and functions of the various grāma-deratas One of such legends tells of Mināciamman of Madura who, assuming the form of Durgā, slew the irreligious Pandya king Another legend describes the birth of Brahmā, Visnu, and Siva out of the egg laid by the village goddess Ammavaru or Ankammā, their rise to power and consequent neglect of the worship of Ammāvaru, and finally their subjugation by Ammavaru This legend obviously reflects the changing fortunes of the grāma-deratās vis-a vis the gods of the Hindu pantheon
The most common village-deity in South India is, of course, Mariammā Many stories are current about the origin of this goddess One of them runs as follows The wife of the sage Jamadagoi and mother of Paraśurāma was so chaste that she could carry water, in a mass, without any vessel, and her wet cloth would fly up into the air and remain there till it became dry One day, however, there occurred an unconscious lapse on her part, and she lost her special power Her husband was enraged, and ordered his son Paraśurāma to take her into the wilderness and cut off her head So the son took his mother away, but as they reached the appointed place, a Pariah woman ran forward and embraced Jamadagni&rsquo;s wife in her arms 10 order to save her Greatly perplexed, but still obedient, Paraśurāma cut off the heads of both of them and went back to his father in great sorrow Jamadagni, pleased at bis son&rsquo;s conduct, offered him a boon Thereupon Paraśurāma asked that his mother be restored to life Jamadagol granted the boon and gave bin some water 10 a vessel and a cane, telling him to put his mother&rsquo;s head on her body, spriokle the water on her, and tap her with the cane In his eager haste, however, Parasurāma put his mother&rsquo;s head on the body of the Pariah woman, and that woman&rsquo;s head on his mother&rsquo;s body, and restored them both to life The woman with
the Brābmana head and the Pariah body was afterwards wor. shipped as Mariammā, while the woman with the Pariah head and the Brāhtpana body came to be worshipped as Yellammā

Can thus legend not be said also to epitomize, 10 a sense, the genesis of the entire body of Hindu mythology, which consists mainly of tho kinds of myths - those having indigenous Indian basis and Brahmanic superstructure and those having Brahmadic basis and indigenous Indian superstructure?

<h3 id="a-birds-eye-view">A BIRD&rsquo;S-EYE VIEW</h3>
<p>A talki on ancient Indian philosophy. may very well be prefaced with a brief statement of the main features which dis. tinguish it from the philosophies of other peoples Unlike many other philosophical systems, Indian philosophy is not merely a system of thought It is essentially a system of life Mere intel. lectual comprehension of the ultimate reality has never been the goal of Indian philosophers, they have always aimed at the spiritual realisation of that reality Indian thinkers, in other words, have always striven to&rsquo;live&rsquo; philosophy, rather than merely to learn and teachit Ancient Sanskrit writers have used a very significant word to denote a system of philosophy, namely, darśana, which means immediate vision of the ultimate reality as against its mediate knowledge
Secondly, most of the philosophical systems of ancient India claim to be mainly based on the Veda Among the valid means of knowledge, therefore, authority of the Veda is invariably placed over and above sensual perception and inference Later on, however, some rationalists did question the absolute validity of the Veda and also openly flouted its authority The philosophical systems in ancient India consequently fall into two categories - the ăstika or orthodox (that is, those which accept the absolute validity of the Veda) and the näsnika or heterodor (that is, those which do not recognise any such claim for the Veda ) The orthodox systems asserted that human sease-organs and human intellect are necessarily limited in scope and power They would, therefore, certainly fail to comprehend the all-com prehensive ultimate reality The teacher of the Taittiriya-Upa

nisad has described the ultimate reality as that wherefrom words turn back, together with the mind, not having attained it.* The ultimate reality is thus indeterminable ercept by means of a human faculty which transcends the senses and the intellect namely, intuition And the Veda is the most perfect expression of the intuitional vision of the ancient seers The faith of the Indian thinkers in the absolute validity of the Veda must not, therefore, be construed as an admission of defeat on their part It rather represents a sort of epistemological optimism, which overcomes the otherwise contingent indeterminism
Just as Indian philosophy transcends, in this manner, the realm of logic, it also transcends the realm of ethics Ultimate philosophy, it is averred, must not be governed by the values of this phenomenal world, which determine ethical conduct and which are necessarily relative and got absolute Indian philo sophy is accordiogly not mere intellectualism nor mere moral ism And yet, paradoxical as it may seem, ancient Indian philosophy has never retaaided an 150lated phenomenon in social history In India, philosophy and social development have influenced each other with very positive results It may, however, be remembered, in this connection, that, though ancient India has produced a variety of pbilosophical systems, they are all marked by a peculiar unity of purpose Sach unity in diversity is, indeed, an outstanding feature of the entire Indian culture Unlike most European philosophical systems, Indian philosophical systems, be it further doted, are not known after individual philosophers It is, therefore, possible to trace the development of philosophical thought in ancient India without any reference to personalities
It 15 customary to discover the origin of the entire ancient Indian thought and practice in the Veda. Such a view, however, is not altogether correct For, doctrines like those of Yoga and atomism, which became prominent in some later philosophucal systems, seem to have been almost unknown to the early Veda It

is, therefore, necessary to trace them to a source other than the Vedic Aryan Some indications of these - particularly of Yoga - are now fortunately brought to light through the archaeological discoveries in the Indus valley Indian philosophy - both ortho dox and heterodox- must, therefore, be said to have been the result of the interaction of two principal currents of thought - the pre-Vedic indigenous Indian current of thought and the Vedic Aryan current of thought In view of the paucity of material re garding the former, however, we have to begin with the Veda
The earliest Vedic texts, namely, the Rgreda and the Atharva reda, are, broadly speaking, collections of prayers and magical incantations respectively of philosophy, in the strictest sense of the term, we find in them but vague beginnings They rather represent the two types of religion - the Rgieda, which is a collec tion of hymns and prayers employed 10 Dature-worship, fire worship, hero-worship, and the Soma cult represents the religion of the classes,&rsquo; while the Athanaveda which contains incantations and formulas of magic and witchcraft, represents the religion of the masses * among the Vedic Indians After a long and stredu ous period of conquest and colonisation, the Vedic Aryans finally settled down in the fertile land of the seven rivers&rsquo; and beyond
They soon felt secure and established fairly prosperous tribal principalities This change in their way of life ellected a change also in their religious outlook and practice in their newly. acquired prosperity and leisure, their simple religion came to be elaborated into a complicated system of ritual And, in course of time, the formal details of this ritual became so very complex that a new well organized class of priests, who alone could master those details, arose in the Vedic society As was expected, o order to serve their own end, these priests, soon enough, elevated sacrifice from being a means to an end to being an end in itself
The total result of all this was threefold Firstly, the spirit of religion was neglected and emphasis came to be placed on its mere form Secondly, since all this was being done in the name of the Veda, an attitude of blind acceptance was deliberately fostered among the common people so that they would ungues.

tioningly accept the interpretation which the priests chose to foist on the Veda And lastly, one class, namely, the priestly class, secured domination over other classes in the society
In a sense, this updue eraltation of sacrifice must be said to have prepared the way for the rise of the truly philosophical speculations 11 ancient India For, the mechanical ritualism sponsored by the Brāhmana texts had its devitable reaction in the form of a two-fold revolt-intellectual and social The yanguards of this revolt nere the teachers of the early Upanisads They raised the banner of free thinking, and encouraged, among the people, an attitude of inquiry They proclaimed that the spirit was more essential than the form And they showed that religion and philosophy Deed oot be the monopoly of any one class
The Uponisads, which, as the word denotes, contain the teachings imparted by a teacher to an esoteric group of pupils, represent the proper beginnings of ancient lodian phưosophical thought For, they deal, more or less exclusively, with the four problems of philosophy - namely those concerning the world, the man, the ultimate reahty, and the mutual relatonship of these three The thiplers of the Upanisads who, be it goted, came from all classes of society, argued empirically like this Jast as the vanous utensils made of clay can be ultimately reduced to one single source, namely, clay, and just as the essential reality underlying those various ateosıls like pitcher, plate, etc is clay, - the pitcher, the plate, etc being mere names and forms -Sim: larly this manifold phenomenal world can be reduced to one siagle ulumate principle, which is called Brahman, and this Brahman is the essential reality underlying the phenomenal world - the phenomenal sorld itself being merely a bundle of pames and forts, and therefore, essentially unreal The Upa nisadıc thinkers also analysed the human persorality Human personality, according to their fir dings was made up of five sheaths (lošas) - cach succeeding sheath lying within the preceding one and, therefore, being more real and essential than the latter These five sheaths are the physical, the vital, the

mental, the intellectual, and the blissful, which last they identified with the soul. It is this last and innermost sheath, pamely, the soul or Ātman, which is the true essence of man It was then but the natural next step for the Upanısads to identify Brabman, the essential reality in the cosmic world, with Atman, the essential reality in man. Though the Upamsads present - and naturally enough - quite a variety of teachings, this doctrine of monistic idealism may, for all practical purposes, be regarded as their most representative teaching Under the spell of audja or pescience, man forgets his true nature and gets involved in this phenomepal world, believing it to be rea] It is, therefore, the aim of pbilosophy to make man realise his essential oneness with the ultimate reality and thus help him to get released from the Samsāra
The religio philosophical thought of the Veda has thus developed through the three logically-as well as chronologically successive stages of the mythology and the magic of the Rgreda and the Athanaveda, the mechanical ritualism of the Brāhmanas, and the monistic idealism of the Upanisads On account of the freshness of their outlook and the profundity of their thought, the Upapasadıc thinkers have left an indelible mark on Indian philosophy As a matter of fact, the Upanısads are regarded, and rightly so, as one of the three foundations on which the noble edifice of Indian philosophy is raised But in the history of ancient Indian philosophy, there came a time when the Upanışadıc thought lost much of its influence This was due to the methods adopted by the Upanisadıc teachers rather than to any intrinsic short comings of their speculations For one thing, the Upanisadıc teachers did pot bother about the process of thought - they oply gave the results and conclusions without their logical background In other words, their method was intuitional, and their appeal mystical This was surely beyond the common man Moreover the essentially individualistic attitude of the Upadisadic teachers, the apparent lack of uniformity in their teachings, and their near

rejection of this world were also responsible for the fact that the Upanisads did not take deep roots among the people at large
presuppose some kind of religion often fails to appeal to the popular mind,
This failure of the early Upan, sads resulted in a spurt, of a sort, of the heterodos systems of thought, like Buddhism and Jainism, which, incidentally, had their roots in the pre-Vedic thought-complex They took advantage of the intellectual atmos phere created by the Upani sads - particularly ther refusal blindly to accept the authonty of the Veda -as also of the philosophical and religious democracy envisaged by them At the same time, they avoided the obvious weak points of the Upan15adic methods Consequently these two, more especially Boddhism, became strong antı-Vedic forces, so much so that, on account of their onslaught, the Vedic way of life and thought was seriously jeopardized In the development of the orthodox philosophical thought there thus ensued a kind of interregnum
But the spark kindled by the Vedas and the Upanisads was not altogether extinguished There still were a large oumber of partisans of the Veda who bravely followed in the trail so finely blazed by their ancestors They started a comprehensive moves ment for consolidating, systematising, and popularising the Vedic
way of life and thought One aspect of this great movement related to the orthodox philosophy This latter now came to be properly organised in the form of six systems in a manner more methodical than the Upanisads, these systems dealt with all the outstanding problems of philosophy They made abundant use of logical reasoning They became at once critical and construc tive In short, with the systems, Indian philosophy became truly self-consciODS
5 It is true that Indian philosophy often characterised as rel.gious mysticism&rdquo; However, what u coded to be suggested here is that people are generally more amenable to some kind of religious practice than to more philosophical contemplation.

INSIGIITS INTO HINDUISM
Though all the six systems claim to owe allegiance to the Veda, only two of them, pamely, the Pūrvamimāmsi of Jarming and the Uttaramināmsī or Vedānta of Bādarāyana, can be said to be directly based on Vedic scriptures, whereas the remaining four, namely, the Sāmkhya of Kapıla, the Yoga of Patañjali, the Vaišesika of Kanāda, and the Nyāya of Gautama, were only indirectly, and, 10 many ceses, in a forced manner, connected with the Veda It must, all the same, be remembered that there are several common points in all these systems - such as, for instance, the Karma theory, the doctrine of the soul, and the doctrine of moksa Another point to be noted about these systems is that all of them cannot be said to be philosophical systems proper The Purvamimīms, is mainly a methodology of interpretation of scriptural texts, the Yoga teaches physical, mental, and spiritual discipline, and the Nyāya is a system of epistemology and logic The truly metaphysical systems are the Vedānta, the Samkhya, and the Vaisesika
The Vedānta aims at establishing a harmony among the apparently inconsistent and self-contradictory Upanisadıc teach 10gs This it does by positing two points of view, the păramár thika (absolute) point of view and the vjāvadārika (relative) point of view it sets forth the Brahman Atman identity as the absolute reality, and the phenomenal world as being only relati vely real On account of insufficient light, a rope appears like a serpent, which it really is not When, however, a light is brought forth, the rope presents itself in its true nature Simi larly, as soon as true knowledge dawns, the phenomenal world vanishes, and the individual soul realises its identity with the cosmic self thus regaining its origioal character
The Samkhya teaches a metaphysical dualism It enunciates two cternal independent entities, the Prakrti and the Purusa The Praksti (or matter ) represents the state of equipoise of the three gunas - sattva, rajas, and tamas The Praktı is 10sentient but
6 Thesc six systems are not inaptly - called systems of salvation DASHIAM, The II onder that was India, 1971, 325 ff

possesses the capacity to undergo modificaton The Purusa (or the soul), on the other hand, is sentiept but immune from any kind of modification By some chance, the Parusa and the Praktı come in contact with each other And, as the result of the seeing&rsquo; on the part of the Purasa, the state of equipoise represented by the Prakrti is disturbed and the process of the evolution of the universe starts Apart from the dualism, another feature, which distinguishes the Samkhya from the Vedānta, is its realism
The Varsesikas also are realists, they have propounded the doctrine of atomic pluralisro Their method is analytical and they have brought metaphysics closer to physics Accordmg to them, in the beginning, there existed an infinite cumber of atoms, subtle and incomprebersible by buman sens organs, each atom being distmguishable from the other, and each possessing some specific quality As the result of some initial urge, these afons began to move and formed different physical combinations The atoms, possessing the quality of odour for instance, were thus grouped together and the earth was created. In this manner, the four elements ne into being, and, out of tben, this mani. fold ponerse Side by side with the plurality of atoms, the Varesikas also assume the existence of a plurality of souls Incidentally, it 15 forth noting that in their early forms, the three metaphysical systems, namely, the Vedānta tbe Simkhya, and the Vanesika were &lsquo;godless systems of thought
The philosophy of the systems later on developed in two directions - each developmert in its owo way, inaugurating a glorious epoch in the history of lodian philosophy The first development was in the direction of a popular synthesis of these systems - the best representarse of such a synthesis being the Bhagavadgitā The second developmert was in the direction of scholastic elaboration of these systems, to which rich contributions have been made by the best brairs of medieval India
