  <p>It was once generally believed that, in the matter of spintual culture, South India was largely - If not exclusively-undebted to the North. A critical study of the cultural history of ancieat Iodia would, however, show that the advent of the Aryans in this country and their subsequent victorious progress altimately resulted not so much in the Aganisation of India as in the Indiadisation of the Aryans Let the illustrate this point with reference to religion. Broadly speakiog, the religion of the Aryans, which is popularly known as Brahmadiso or Vedic religion, developed mainly through three distinct stages - the cosmic-heroic worship of the RgTeda-Samhurā, the complex ntua lism of the Brāhmaner, and the mystic idealism of the Upanisads Obrously, such a religon, particularly in the form which it bad assumed in the age of the early Upanisads, mas not likely to satisfy the religious urge of the people at Large Though, there fore, its first Ausb, this hieratic Brahmanism seemed to dominate the religious scene of Northern India, its unidence soon began to wane The penod immediately following the prigcipal Upanısads, accordingly, saw the rise of new religious beliefs and practices Actually, these beliefs and practices were by no means new They had already been in eustence in this courtry to a Tesser or greater extent. But, 111 course of time, they ane to be suppressed by the religious ideology of the victorious Aryans Indeed, it is this latter ideology which must be characterized as Des and exotic As I bare said, the Vedic religion overwhelmed the earlier religions, but only temporanly Lo the post-Upanısadıc period, several pre-Vedic non-Aryan religious movements began to make their influence felt. Such were, for instance, the move ments which later consolidated themselves in the form of Buddhism and Jainis. The attitude of these two religions was asowedly acti-Vedic For my present purpose, I Deed not dilate upon their future history I may only say that it completely belied their

INSIGHTS INTO HINDUISM
early promise One of them disappeared, almost entirely, from the land of its birth, while the other persisted but with a very restricted currency
It is still another religious movement, which also, in a sense, arose by way of a reaction against the hieratic Brahman ism, that is relevant to our purpose The sponsors of that movement must be said to have taken an essentially practical and realistic view of things they realised that the gods of the official Vedic pantheon, like Varuna and Indra, the very compli cated system of Brahmanic sacrifice, and the highly esoteric teachings of the Upanisads bad almost ceased to appeal to the popular imagination, and that, therefore, people were again turning back to the various pre-Vedic religious cults They also realised that the Veda still contipued to have a sufficiently strong hold on certain influential classes, and that an anti-Vedic attitude, by itself, did not generally find favour with the people They, therefore, sought to bring together, under a common fold, the various popular cults, which were non-Vedic, but not necessarily anti-Vedic, in origin and character, and which, despite the preva lence of Brahmanism among certain sections, still commanded large following among the masses But, while doing so, they took care to see that this new popular religion did not divorce itself completely from the Veda On the contrary, this new religion openly accepted allegiance to the Veda And though, in actual practice, this allegiance proved to be just nomipal, it definitely served to hold together the many, originally unrelated, popular cults This is how popular Hinduism, which symbolises the rel gious culture of the majority of Indians even today, originated In course of time, even the staunch votaries of Brahmanism, who were making a last bid to save their Vedic heritage against the opslaught of the anti-Vedic crusaders saw in the rise of Hinduism a welcome opportunity to preserve at least some vestiges of it If, however, one compared Brahmanism and Hinduism, one would find (dat, ra the mythology and religious practices of the latter, there were more indigenous Indian elements than the Vedic odes And not a few of these were derived from South India

Perhaps the greatest gift of South India to Hinduism is god Siva The primare religion of South India may be described as a form of shamanism, in which the simple folk indulged in ecstatic religious practices and sought to propitiate their god mamly with the offerings of blood Presumably, on account of sich offerings of blood, this god came to be alled Sma, ich word in proto-Draydian meant red' Apart from the rude icons reddened with blood, this god of the proto-Dravidians seems to have been represented also through two other symbols, namely, the linga or the phallus and the bull There is, indeed, ample evidence to show that, long before the adient of the Aryans, the cult of this popular proto-Indian god had spread far and wide in this country- different aspects of his religion being specially emphasized in different regops He was, for instance, celebrated as Sia in South India and as Pasupati to the lados Valley as Bhava by the Bāhikas and as Sarra by the Easterners
Some of the religious practices associated with Sua fete obviously such as clearly offended the susceptibilities of the hieratic poet-prests of the Veda. At the same time, the popular pressure in favour of sna mas so great that those poet-priests could not belp making room for that god in their pantheon. The Vedic Rudra represents, both 10 pace and character, a brahma Dised version of the proto-Indian Siya. Naturally enough, Rudra 1$ seen to have been deliberately isolated in the Vedic mythology acd ntual. But, with the rise of popolar Hindaism, this recalci trance was completely overcome, and Siva&ndash;his con-Aryan name now beug understood in its Aryan sense of benevolebt', but most of the other traits of bis ongial character and cult being presented intact - came to be conceded a very prominent place among the Hindu gods As a natural consequence of this, several religious practices associated with the cult of Siva, soch as pūja, balı, and joga, which, incidentally, Fere essentially non-Vedic in origin and character, came to be introduced into Hinduism, and Hindu mythology care to be enriched by many a legend celebrat 10g Sisa and his other ancillary disznities.

begun round about 1000 B C and to have been completed before the times of Asoka Surely, it was this historical process which gave rise to the cycle of Agastya legends in Hindu mythology Even Tamil literature has its own traditions about Agastya According to one such tradition, a large number of gods and sages had assembled in the Himalayas to attend the wedding of Siva and Pārvati The sheer weight of this august assembly caused the earth to sink down towards the north, thereby jeopardising all creation At that juncture, the gods and the sages hit upon the idea of sending Agastya to the South in order to restore the disturbed balance of the earth Before Agastya proceeded on this mission of deliverance, he went to the river Ganga and obtained from her the river Kāveri He also married Lopāmudrā, and secured Jamadagor&rsquo;s son, Trnadhūmāgni, as his pupil He further persuaded eighteen members of the Vrsni family of Dvārakā and eighteen crores of Vēlır and Aruvālar to accompany him to the South With this large following, he came down to the Vindhyas, cut down the forests, set up, with the help of Kāyeri, extensive colonies in what was originally a wilderness, and finally made his own home in the hill of Podiyil in the southern part of the Western Ghats Another tradition makes Agastyas pupil Trnadhūmigo, who had in the mean time assumed the name of Tolkappiyar, the author of the oldest Tamil grammar Tolkoppiyam Still another tradition speaks of Agastya&rsquo;s having been the Kulaguru of the first Pandya ruler, who, inci dentally, claimed to be the descendant of Sıva All these Tamil traditions evidently confirm and supplement the history underly ing the epic legends
The so-called Aryanisation of South India was in several respects quite unlike the Aryanisation of North India Firstly, this movement was of the nature of Hinduisation rather than of Aryanisation For, the most tangible result of it was the accep tance by the South Indians pot of Vedic theology but of Hindu BOCYDOBY as refecitá m The caste system Seconäry, this movement does not seem to have evoked much opposition on the contrary, there is evideoce to show that the changes wrought by it were

Welcomed by the Dravidians with alacrity And, thirdly, the incursions from the North were not so violent as to root out the languages and the peculiar religious culture of the South. Indeed, this contact between the North and the South involved much give and take - perhaps more gise than &ldquo;take on the side of the Dravidians For instance, the suddha bhakn or the way of unmixed personal desotion to God is believed to have been the special contribution of South India to Indian religious thought. According to the Padmapurana, bhalni originated in the Dravida country, passed from there into the Maratha country, and finally reached the Gangetic doab round Mathurā The therarams and the prabandhams of the Tamil saints, read with the Bhāgavata purāna, which latter speaks of the very large number of bhakras 10 the Dravida country, would also seem to confirm this tradition Four gods are specifically menuioned 12 this connection, namely, the “ red one with blue throat” or Siva, the &ldquo;white one of the ploughshare and the palmyra flag” or Baladeva, the blue one with the eagle flag&rdquo; or Krsoa, and &ldquo;the rider on the elephant With the peacock-fag&rdquo; or Subrahmanya The manner in which these gods are referred to by Nakkirār in his poem suggests their having been regarded as peculiarly Tamil gods
Co-existence was the watchx ord of the religious life of the hinduised South India. Vedic ritual was practised side by side with the elaborate pūjā of the Hindu gods, and even the Buddhists and the Jaipas freely followed their religious practices But the religion, which could be characterised as specifically South Indian, concerned the village-gods of those people in spite of the influences from the North - whether Brabmanıc or Hindu - more than eighty per cent of the population continued to worship their primitise local divities in every village in South India may be seen, even today, a shrine or a syobol of its own gräma-derată, who is propitiated, periodically and with communal worship, in order to avert pestilence, famine, or any other calamity befalling man or animal This religion does not boast of any syster of phulosophy as its foundation, por of any vniform ritual as its superstructure But it certainly has its own mythology. A major

part of this mythology is preserved in the form of confused legends by the families of Asādıs, and revolves round the origin and functions of the various grāma-deratas One of such legends tells of Mināciamman of Madura who, assuming the form of Durgā, slew the irreligious Pandya king Another legend describes the birth of Brahmā, Visnu, and Siva out of the egg laid by the village goddess Ammavaru or Ankammā, their rise to power and consequent neglect of the worship of Ammāvaru, and finally their subjugation by Ammavaru This legend obviously reflects the changing fortunes of the grāma-deratās vis-a vis the gods of the Hindu pantheon
The most common village-deity in South India is, of course, Mariammā Many stories are current about the origin of this goddess One of them runs as follows The wife of the sage Jamadagoi and mother of Paraśurāma was so chaste that she could carry water, in a mass, without any vessel, and her wet cloth would fly up into the air and remain there till it became dry One day, however, there occurred an unconscious lapse on her part, and she lost her special power Her husband was enraged, and ordered his son Paraśurāma to take her into the wilderness and cut off her head So the son took his mother away, but as they reached the appointed place, a Pariah woman ran forward and embraced Jamadagni&rsquo;s wife in her arms 10 order to save her Greatly perplexed, but still obedient, Paraśurāma cut off the heads of both of them and went back to his father in great sorrow Jamadagni, pleased at bis son&rsquo;s conduct, offered him a boon Thereupon Paraśurāma asked that his mother be restored to life Jamadagol granted the boon and gave bin some water 10 a vessel and a cane, telling him to put his mother&rsquo;s head on her body, spriokle the water on her, and tap her with the cane In his eager haste, however, Parasurāma put his mother&rsquo;s head on the body of the Pariah woman, and that woman&rsquo;s head on his mother&rsquo;s body, and restored them both to life The woman with
the Brābmana head and the Pariah body was afterwards wor. shipped as Mariammā, while the woman with the Pariah head and the Brāhtpana body came to be worshipped as Yellammā

Can thus legend not be said also to epitomize, 10 a sense, the genesis of the entire body of Hindu mythology, which consists mainly of tho kinds of myths - those having indigenous Indian basis and Brahmanic superstructure and those having Brahmadic basis and indigenous Indian superstructure?
