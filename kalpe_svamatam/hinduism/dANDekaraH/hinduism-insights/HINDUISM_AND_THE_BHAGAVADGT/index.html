  <h2 id="a-fresh-approach">A FRESH APPROACH</h2>
<p>A proper appreciation of the essential distinction between Vedism (which is more popularly known as Brahmanism) on the one hand and Hinduism on the other would ensure the right perspective in the study of ancient Indian religious thought Broadly speaking, the Brahmanic thought, which was, in a sense, exotic on the Indian soil, may be said to have developed - both 10 logical as well as chronological sequence - from the stage of the cosmic-heroic mythology and magic of the Vedic Samhitās, through the stage of the mechanical sacerdotalism of the Brahmanas, to the stage of the monistic idealism of the Upanisads. Paradoxically enough this last stage, which, indeed, represented the very acme of Vedic speculations, also proved to be, from a certain point of view, the harbinger of the decline of Vedism as such. On account of some of their peculiar characteristics, the Upanisadıc teachings, which were the result of the way of thought of the few, could not possibly become translated into the way of life of the many.</p>
<p>This state of things gave rise to three main tendencies, each tendency representing, in its own way, a signifi cant turning point in the cultural history of ancient India.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, systems of thought, like Buddhism and Jainism, which are generally regarded as heterodox because they do not accept the ultimate valıdity of the Veda but which can be actually traced back to an indigenous Indian origin in the form of a common pre-Vedic thought complex, were quick in taking advantage of the atmosphere of free thinking created by the Upanisads and of the religious vacuum which had been engendered at that time They carried their appeal to the masses with great vigour, and ultimately succeeded, to a large extent, in winning them over. This resulted in the rapid growth of those heterodox religions - particularly Buddhism - and the corresponding decline of Brahmanism.</li>
<li>But Brahmanism, which had such a glorious past, could by no means be expected to become altogether extinct under the pressure-hosocier strong-of the non-Brahmadıc movements. On the contrary, by way of a reaction agamst the growing popularity of the non-Brahmanic thought, it made a last bid for regaining its lost prestige. This was the second tendency, and it found its literary expression in the Vedic Sütras and the other ancillary Vedic literature called Vedāngas.</li>
<li>The third tendency steered a course intermediate between the anti-Brahmanism of the heterodox religions on the one hand and the revivalism of the promoters of the Sätra-Vedānga movement on the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even from very early times, there had existed in India, side by side with the hieratic Vedic religion, several popular tribal religions The gods and goddesses of these tribal people were different from the divities of the official Vedic pantheon Their religious practices also differed fundamentally from the religious practices of the Vedic Arjaos. Indeed, these tribal religions were definitely noo-Vedic in provenance and character. It is een possible to discover the beginnings in the ideology of the pre Vedic non-Aryan indigenous population of India. From this point of view at least, they were more akin to the heterodox systems of thought referred to above. But there has one point of essential differcoce between these fro These popolar tribal religions soon and under the spell of Vediso And, though they did not actually adopt the religious ideology and practices of Vedism in any appreciable measure, they followed the very practical acd realistic course of allowing allegiance to the Veda - howsoever gonnal and superficial that allegiance might have proved to be in actuality. Naturally though, while Brahmanism kad been so ascendancy, the sphere of midence of these popular religions was restricted to the respective tribes among whom thsy had originated.

could not be effectively met by mere revivalist efforts A common popular front wis required to be presented against them Conse quently, most of the popular religions, with their variety of gods and religious practices, came to be organized into one single but multi-charactered whole, which was held together by means of the thin thread of their allegiance to the Veda This is the genesis of Hinduism Hinduism, in its origin, was verily a parliament of religions, over which the Veda formally presided but whose normal functioning, like any other presiding authority in modern parliamentary systems, it does not seem to have noticeably influenced It may te pointed out that the third tendency, mentioned above, manifested itself in the form of Hinduism, which, while effectively arresting the growth of anti-Brahmanic thought, successfully combated the insularity and exclusiveness of Brahmanism by bringing together under its banner large masses of people and, at the same time, kept the Vedic tradition alive
One very significant constituent of this all inclusive Hinduism was Krsnaism This religion seems to have originated and spread among the tribes of Western and Central India, like the Vrsons, the Sātvatas, the Abhiras, and the Yādavas Its priocipal teacher was Kęsna who is seen to have been associated with the above mentioned tribes in one way or another 1 He was presumably the temporal head as well as the spiritual leader, and was, in course of time, transformed into a tribal god. That this tribal god and the religious movement inspired by him were originally not countenanced by the hieratic Vedic religion 18 jadicated by the episode of the Govardhana mountain, which portrays the chief Vedic God Indra&rsquo;s antagonism to and subsequent subjugation by Krsna This is clearly symbolical of the popular tribal religion having prevailed over the hieratic Brahmanıc religion But the religion of Krsna may generally be said to be typifying the paradoxical characteristic of Hinduism, mentioned above, namely,

a fundamental departure from Brahima is so far as its basic tedets are concerned coupled with a deliberate pon-aburation of loyalty to the Veda
The Bhagavadgita, which is by far the most well-known religio-pbulosophical text in Sanskrit, may be fooled upon as ad authoritate manual of Krsnate religion, philosophy, and ethics Wher, in the course of the growtå of the drahábhárara, the bardic historical poem, Jaja, was being transformed into the primary cpic, Bhārata, tiyo pripcipal processes had been in operation, zamely, the bandic ealargement of the original ballad-cycle relating to the Kuru Bharatas and the Krsmate redaction of the bardıc material Presumably the Bhagaradgita served as the corper-stone of this Krsparte superstructure It has, however, to be remembered that, though the Bhagaradgita originally epitomi sed the teachings of Krsna, after it had been included into the epic, it also was subjected to the final process of Brahmanic revision like the rest of the epic
The religion of Krsoa differed from the finally developed form of the Vedic ideology, firstly, in its teaching about the goal of hu man life The earlier Upanisads, which give the most consummate espression to the Vedic thought in this connection, have generally put forth the view that, since this phenomenal sorld and the honan existence, so far as this latter &gt; governed by the body-mind-com plex, are fundamentally unreal, man must renounce this worldly Life and aim at realising the ongoai esseotral identity of his soul with the Universal Self, which is the one and the only absolute reality It will be thus seca that the Upsosadis attitude is essentially indi Hidualistic and, to a large etteat, negatire The Bhagaradgilā, on the other hand, teaches that man&rsquo;s chief duty 15 the promotion of lokasamgralia, that is to say, of the stability, solidanty, and progress of the society The society can function properly only on the principle of the chal roterdependence of its ranoz constituents Man must, therefore, see to it that, as an essential

constituent of the society, he furthers this process of lokasamgraha through an active awareness of his social obligations The Bhagavadgită has thus invested its teaching with positive social values The svadharma or specific social obligations of different types of men are, according to the Bhagavadgita, best embodied 10 the doctrine of câturiarnja or the scheme of four social orders Though the adoption of this doctripe by the Bhagavadgitā may have been due, to a certain extent, to the Brahmanic influence, the way in which it has sponsored it is peculiarly its own Unlike the Brahmanic texts, the Bhagavadgitā pever refers to the superio rity of one social order to another It consistently emphasizes only the socio ethical sigoificance of that scheme All social orders are equal and essential from the socio-ethical point of view It' would, 10deed, seem that the insistence of the Bhagavadgita was mainly on man&rsquo;s active recognition of his svadharma or social obligations, the cãtunarnya having been referred to-almost by way of an example-as a scheme, which, in the context of certain specific circumstances, best ensured the recognition by men of their respective svadharmas
The second fundamental point in which the Bhagavadgită differs from the Vedic thought follows logically from the first As indicated above, the Upadisadıc ideal of spiritual emancipation through self realisation presupposes the acceptance of the woreai character of the phenomenal world Through his actions, man gets entangled, consciously or unconsciously, in the tantaliziog affairs of this fictitious world and is thus removed farther and farther away from his goal A complete abnegation of action, therefore, came to be regarded almost as a sine que non of a true seeker&rsquo;s spiritual quest On the other hand, the ideal of lokasamgraha through the fulfilment of svadharma, enjoined by the Bhagavadgitā, necessarily implies an active way of life The Bhagavadgita, 10 deed, often Speaks in terms of joga (from the root yu=to apply oneself to ) rather than of moksa (from the desiderative of the root muc=to untie or to loose) The teacher of th eBhagavad

gira has discussed, at great length, the why and the how of this karmayoga Verily, that is the main therae of the poem. The activism sbuch the Bhagavadgită seeks to inculcate is, however, not of the common type It is certainly unique in that it is traged - perhaps, under the influence of the Upansadıc thought with some element of renunciation The Bhagavadgitā attempts to reconcile its ideal of lokasamgraha or social solidanty and progress with the Upanisadic ideal of rolsa or spiritual emanci pation of an individual It argues that action, as such, does not prore deinmental to one&rsquo;s anainment of his spinnual goal It is his attachment to the fruits of his actions that keeps him eternally unvolved in the cycle of births aod deaths The Bhagaradgita, therefore, teaches its Yoga or skulfal art of &ldquo;how to act without being involved in the consequences of action. It teaches the anasaktı-joga, that is, renunciation in action and not of action
The activism (kormaloga) of the Bhagavadgit must by DO means be confused with the way of work (1 armakanda) of the ntut Lustic texts If the way of renunciation, taught by the Upanisads, was inconsistent with the ideal of the Bhagavadgură, the way of work taught by the Brāhmanas and the Sūtras, buch was actually constituted of ritualistic practices and as a reaction against which the Upanısadıc doctrine of renonciation had erotred, was more so The elaborate and the highly complex system of sacrifice could never have become the religion of the people * Krsta, there fore, sponsored a pay of spiritual life in which everybody - Irespectne of caste, creed, and sex - could participate It was the way of bhaktı or desotion. The way of bhaktı presupposes the recognition of a personal god -10 the present context, of coprse, Krsna himself - who is regarded as being responsible for the creation, preservation, and destruction of the perse The dezotee senses that God like a loyal servant, always craving for some kind of personal comunion with Him. The criterion of true worship according to the doctrine of bhaktı, is not the

richness or profuseness of the materials used for worsbup nor the number and variety of religious observances involved in it It 1$ rather the urge and the earnestness, the faith and the sense of complete surrender to the Divine, on the part of the devotee Such a bhahta - whatever his age, sex, learning, or social status indeed, compels God to become his friend, guide, and philosopher, The way of bhakti is thus more simple, more direct, and more effective than any other religious practice And the cultural history of India bears ample testimony to the fact that the cult of bhaklı has proved to be the only force, which could unite large and heterogeneous masses of people into one truly democratic religious brotherhood in his teaching of bhakti, however, Krsna has made one sigoificaat addition He has insisted that a true harmayogin, that is, one who adopts the activism as taught by the Bhagavadgita as his way of life, alone can become a true bhakra, for, by following his svadharma, the karmayogin is only promoting the will of God and is participating in the fulhiment of the divine project
It has already been pointed out that the Bhagavadgita could not altogether give up the Upanisadıc ideal of moksa It could not also altogether evade the ritualism of the Brālimanas While, therefore, coordinating it with its own thought-pattern the Bhagavadgitā stressed the spirit of the sacrificial ritual rather than its form It seems to have been suggested that, just as loka samgraha implies the ethical interdependence in the social sphere, sacrifice implies the ethical interdependence in the cosmic sphere
krsnaism cannot boast of any independent philosophical system of its own As a shrewd leader of the people, Kșşaa had realised that what the people wanted was not so much an abstract, metaphysical way of thought as a concrete, practical way of life He, therefore gave them a religion and a code of conduct The different schools of philosopby which were then prevailing, tended, on the one hand, to confound the people at large and, on the other, to encourage dogmatism among their respective

followers And dogmatism - whether religious or phulosophical - often tends to divide rather than to unite The Bhagaradgut, therefore, instead of dilating upon the points of difference among the various systems of thought and practice, emphasised the points of agreement among them and thereby brought about a positive philosophical and religions synthesis? And, it may be recalled, synthesis is the very watchword of Hipduism
It has been alreads suggested that at one stage, like the other parts of the Jahābhārala, the Bhagaralgitā also must have undergone a kind of Brahmanic reonentation - however artificial and superficial that reorientation might have been This 15, indeed, true of Hinduism as a whole One of the more significant results of tos reonentation, so far as the personality of Krsoa was concerned, was that that tribal god who was essentially non-Vedic in origin and who had already developed a composite personality, cute to be regarded as an atatāra ( cardation) of the All-god and also as being identical with the Upanısadıc brahman
