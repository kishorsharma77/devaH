      <description>A BIRD&amp;rsquo;S-EYE VIEW A talki on ancient Indian philosophy. may very well be prefaced with a brief statement of the main features which dis. tinguish it from the philosophies of other peoples Unlike many other philosophical systems, Indian philosophy is not merely a system of thought It is essentially a system of life Mere intel. lectual comprehension of the ultimate reality has never been the goal of Indian philosophers, they have always aimed at the spiritual realisation of that reality Indian thinkers, in other words, have always striven to&amp;rsquo;live&#39; philosophy, rather than merely to learn and teachit Ancient Sanskrit writers have used a very significant word to denote a system of philosophy, namely, darśana, which means immediate vision of the ultimate reality as against its mediate knowledge Secondly, most of the philosophical systems of ancient India claim to be mainly based on the Veda Among the valid means of knowledge, therefore, authority of the Veda is invariably placed over and above sensual perception and inference Later on, however, some rationalists did question the absolute validity of the Veda and also openly flouted its authority The philosophical systems in ancient India consequently fall into two categories - the ăstika or orthodox (that is, those which accept the absolute validity of the Veda) and the näsnika or heterodor (that is, those which do not recognise any such claim for the Veda ) The orthodox systems asserted that human sease-organs and human intellect are necessarily limited in scope and power They would, therefore, certainly fail to comprehend the all-com prehensive ultimate reality The teacher of the Taittiriya-Upa 2 Reason for the Bunday SGT OA IP du f-1-1960 2 Specifically, what may be called Brabmınıc philosophy v intended bere ANCIENT INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 381 nisad has described the ultimate reality as that wherefrom words turn back, together with the mind, not having attained it.</description>

      <description>It is now generally agreed that man is basically &amp;amp; religious creature As a finite beisg, he instinctively yearns for the infinite Actually he seeks in the Infinite the solace and support for his ono finite life As the Chandogja-Upanisad says! Jo vai bhima tai sulham, ra’lpe sulham astı It is, indeed, the potential infinity in his finite personality &amp;ndash; his instinctive urge to transcend the finiteness from which he suffers - that produces 10 man what ray be called a religious feeling And the most basic factor in this religious feeling may be said to be a vague sense of some power which permeates and directs man and the uonerse The doctrine relating to this power is represented by the historidas as religion under various nanes, such as adimism, manaism, aumenism, dynamism, and theism.</description>

      <description>RETROSPECT Proto-Historic Hudakto Hinduism is in no sepse revealed to or founded by any pro phet or messiah. It is, therefore not possible to speak of the specific origin of that religion All that we may do in this connection is to go back to the earliest period in the history of India when some of the distinctive features of the Hindu religion as we know it today had already become manifest Not many years ago, the spade of the archaeologist unearthed a whole civilizauon in the salley of the river Indus - first centering round Mohenjo Daro and then primarily round Harappa - and thereby gave quite a nen onentation to the history of India The age of the newly discovered Indus civilization - which is now more popularly known as the Harappan Civilization - is generally believed to have extended from 3500 BC to 2200 BCA considerable amount of material has become available from the excavations carned out at Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, and other related sites which throws ample light on the various aspects of that civilization, including religion.</description>

      <description>A FRESH APPROACH A proper appreciation of the essential distinction between Vedism (which is more popularly known as Brahmanism) on the one hand and Hinduism on the other would ensure the right perspective in the study of ancient Indian religious thought Broadly speaking, the Brahmanic thought, which was, in a sense, exotic on the Indian soil, may be said to have developed - both 10 logical as well as chronological sequence - from the stage of the cosmic-heroic mythology and magic of the Vedic Samhitās, through the stage of the mechanical sacerdotalism of the Brahmanas, to the stage of the monistic idealism of the Upanisads.</description>

      <description>The Brahmanic religion, in its different phases, can boast of a vast and traditionally continuous literature, which concerns itself, directly or indirectly, with the various aspects of that religion An attempt will be made in this paper to present a connected historical account of this literature, from the age of the Veda down to about the end of the medieval period of course, on account of its decessary limitations, this survey will take into account only the more significant literary works, and, here too, special consideration will be given to such of these works as do not usually receive adequate treatment Speaking of the literature of Brahmanism, one has to begin with the Veda A mention may, first of all, be made of certain distinctive features of the Veda The term Veda&#39; does pot denote any one siogle book-it denotes an entire literature, which is strikingly extensive from the points of view of chronology, geography, and authorship The composition of the various texts which are believed to constitute the Veda has spread over many centuries and over different localities and has to be ascribed to many generations of poets, priests, and philosophers But the ancient tradition in connection with the genesis of the Veda would not warrant the use of such words as composition&#39;, authorshp&#39;, etc, in respect of it For, it is traditionally claimed that the Veda is apauruseja - that is to say, do human agency is responsible for its creation The Veda has existed from times immemorial, and the activity of the various Rsis (Seers) 10 connection with it is restricted only to seeing&#39; or discovering&#39; it The claim of apaurusejarva made on behalf of the Veda has naturally given rise to another claim namely of reda prāmänja The Veda, being free from all the limitations and deficiencies usually associated 1 As will be seen, the term As Brahmanıca here used in a very wide LITERATURE OF BRAHVANISM 321 with human agency, possesses absolute validity in the field of knowledge The Veda has been transmitted from generation to generation through oral tradition It is called Sruti, because it was recited and beard&#39;, and not written and read 2 Though, as suggested above, the Veda signifies not any single specific text but a veri table library of texts, which are remarkably saned in form and content, there is Des ertheless a thread of logical development which runs through it and wbich thus bestows upon it a kind of distinc tire unity The Vedic literary history is usually divided into three main periods, namely, the Samhna-period, the Brāhmand period, and the Upanisad-period Broadly speaking, these periods represent a chronological as well as a logcal sequence Lastly, a reference may be made to another feature of the Veda which is important from the point of view of the literary history It concerns the emergence, 19 course of ume, of various Vedic takhis which have sponsored their own recensions of the different Vedic texts Before proceeding to a further consideration of the three periods of the Vedic literary history, one may clanfy a few points which have sometimes occasioned a wrong perspective Firstly, it needs to be pointed out that, side by side with the Vedic litera ture, there must have been produced in that age much other litera tore, which, however had cot been consolidated and given a fixed form in its early stages.</description>

      <description>A BROAD OUTLINE It has been observed that the basic dogma of the Sophists, whose important role in the history of the Western philosophical thought must not be underestimated, is best represented in the momentous words of Protagoras ( 500 BC), namely, Man is the measure of all things&#39; It bas been further observed that this dogma of theirs has held good in the West ever since If the Iodian philosophical thought anywhere differs pronouncedly from the Western philosophical thought it is, indeed, in this very respect For, the most distject ve feature of the speculative Wis dom of the Indians is its essentially cosmic character According to lodian thinkers, from the ultimate philosoplucal point of view, man cannot be regarded as, in any way, standing apart from the universe, much less as enjoying any preponderance at Their speculations have, therefore, never tended to become anthropo centric They look upon man just as part aod parcel of the Universe - just as one of the maoy forms in which the Supreme Being is manifested in this universe As the seer of the Brhadaranjaka Upanisad&#39; has put in a very telling manner, &amp;lsquo;(The essential self or the vital essence in man, atman), is the same as that in ant, the same as that in gnat, the same as that in elephant, the same as that in these three worlds indeed, the same as that in the whole unterse: It will be accordingly seen that the dualism between * man and other things in the unrerse, wbich is implied in the words of Protagoras, does not find countenance in the early Iodiad thought.</description>

      <description>It was once generally believed that, in the matter of spintual culture, South India was largely - If not exclusively-undebted to the North. A critical study of the cultural history of ancieat Iodia would, however, show that the advent of the Aryans in this country and their subsequent victorious progress altimately resulted not so much in the Aganisation of India as in the Indiadisation of the Aryans Let the illustrate this point with reference to religion.</description>

      <description>The subject of my talk1 has been appounced as &amp;ldquo;The Beginnings of Vaišnavism &amp;quot; What, however, I propose to do this evening is to make a few general observations on the early phases of Vaisnavism as reflected in Panini&amp;rsquo;s Astādhyāyi and Patañjali&amp;rsquo;s great commentary on it Without discussiog at any length the question of the dates of Panini and Patañjali, for my present purpose, I take Pāniji to have lived in the fifth century B C and Patañjalı about 150 B C I am aware of the view of some scholars that the Mahābhasya (MB) contains certain inter polations made at a much later date, but I do not find that view quite convincing I shall begin with the assumption, which, I believe, will be readily acceptable to all, namely, that, when the Vedic Aryans arrived in India, there was by no means any kind of religious vacuum in this country Different religious cuits prevailed in different regions of the pre-Vedic non-Aryan India It is possible to identify at least two main such cults, which I would designate as the Muni-Yati-cult and the Bhakti cult in contradis tinction from the Vedic Aryan religious cult which I would characterise as the Rsi cult Broadly speaking, the Muni-Yati cult subsisted as a dominant feature of the Pasupati Sıva religion of the Indus valley as also of the ancient Magadhan religious complex which latter eventually proved to be the fountaid-head of Jainism and Buddhism among others.</description>

      <description>Lecture 1 It has been said that man looks zward, he looks around, and he looks upward, and out of his response and reaction to this threefold looking&#39; of bis are born his religion and philo sophy To put the same thing la other words, man (25 implied by looking inward&amp;quot;), universe (as implied by &amp;lsquo;lookuog around&amp;rsquo;), and god (as implied by looking upward&#39;) are the three basic themes of man&amp;rsquo;s religio-philosophical speculations You art, perhaps, aware that I have already sitten and published to monographs-one og &amp;ldquo;Man in Hindu thought&amp;rdquo; and the other on &amp;ldquo;God in Hindu Thought&amp;rdquo; .</description>

      <description>Hınduism is, in any respects, a unique plenoreron in the history of religions Indeed, Hırdaism can tardi, be called a religion in the popularly coderstood sense of the term Unlike most religions, Hinduism does pot regard the concept of god as being central to it Hiccusm is not a system of theology - It does not make any dogmatic afirmation regarding the nature of god And, yet, shat often appear, confusing to superficial ob servers is that the Hicdus are seen to worship many gods though they may be actually believing 17 oply ope god as the sipgle ultimate reality Similarly, Hicdaism does not venerate any particular person as its sole prophet or founder It does not also recognize any particular bool as its absolutely authoritate scripture Further, Hirdem dos cot insist on any particular religous practice as being obligaton, por does it accept any doctrine as its dogma Hioddisin can also pot te identified with a specific woral code Hindy sm, as a rel gop does not convey any defpite or unitary ide3 There is no dogma or practice which can be said to be eitter bonersel or essential to Hmdois as a #bole lodeed, those sho call themselves Hindus may not peces sarily have such 18 commop as regards faith or worship What 15 essential for one section of the Hindu commud&amp;rsquo;ty may not be necessarily so for apotter lodeed, even within a particular sect of Hindum, the essentials can hardly be separated from the non essentials Towithstacdıng all this Hiodam tas persisted through centuries as a distinct religious epttv.</description>
