I shall begin with the assumption, which, I believe, will be readily acceptable to all, namely, that, when the Vedic Aryans arrived in India, there was by no means any kind of religious vacuum in this country Different religious cuits prevailed in different regions of the pre-Vedic non-Aryan India It is possible to identify at least two main such cults, which I would designate as the Muni-Yati-cult and the Bhakti cult in contradis tinction from the Vedic Aryan religious cult which I would characterise as the Rsi cult Broadly speaking, the Muni-Yati cult subsisted as a dominant feature of the Pasupati Sıva religion of the Indus valley as also of the ancient Magadhan religious complex which latter eventually proved to be the fountaid-head of Jainism and Buddhism among others. It may be presumed that the indigenous Muni-Yatı and Bhakti-cults and the exotic Rsi cult exercised significant influence upon one another, both 10 a positive and a negative sense For instance, the Vedic god Rudra is but a Vedic Aryan ver5100 of the pre-Vedic non-Aryan

Siya, both in name and character On the other hand, there are clear indications in the Rgreda of the Vedic Arad antagonism towards the Yatıs, the spades3s, and the Mūradevast It is again pot improbable that Vasistba&rsquo;s attitude towards Varuna was influenced by the indigenous Bhakti-cult It would seem that, on account of its freshness, vigour, and flush of victory, the Vedic Arjan religion oser shelmed the various indigenous religions cults and kept them under suppression for a fairly long time Wyben, however, the hold of that religion upon the people at large began to dwindle owing to various obvious reasons in the last days of the major Upanısads, that is, in the seventh-sixth centuries B.C, the indigenous religious cults again came into their own and soon developed into potent religious forces to such an extent that they eventually came to pose a serious challenge to the Vedic religion itself
The doctrine of Bhakts may be said to constitute perhaps the most significant feature of what we today understand by Vaisna. Vism And one of the correlates of Bhakti is the concept of a sis, that is, special benediction or grace of god In P (Panipi-Süira) VI 2 148, kārakad dallašrutas or enā &lsquo;$131, there occurs an indica tion of such benediction or grace Speaking about the accent, this Sutra tells us that, in respect of a nume, huch implies benediction, such as Devadatta ( which is explained as dera enom dejāsuh), the posterior member of the compound being a past passive participle, gets the Udátta accent on its last syllable, only 1 that past passive participle 15 either dorta or fruta. It is suggested that a similar kind of benediction or grace is intended also in P V 3 847
More pertinent to our present purpose, however, is the group of Sutras, P IV 3 95-99 P IV 395 is made up of one single

word, namely, bhaktıh But, in this context, the word bhakti is used in a variety of senses, such as, &lsquo;attachment&rsquo;, &lsquo;liking&rsquo;, &lsquo;loyalty&rsquo;, and religious devotion&rsquo; It may also be noted that, here, commentators understand the word bhah in the sense of object of bhakır' (bhaktivisaja) The Sutras mention different termipa tions to be affixed to different words while forming from those words derivatives meaning persons who entertain bhakt for the entities (things, persons, etc ) denoted by those words For instance, according to P IV 395, as explained by commentators, the termination an is used in the case of persons entertaining bhaktı or attachment for a certain locality Thus a person, the ob ject of whose bhak 11 or attachment is Srughna, is called Sraughna In the case of a person who entertains bhahti or liking for a thing, which is insentient and which denotes something other than space or time, the termination is thak 9 Accordingly, one, the object of whose liking is apūpa, is called apūpika 10 The termination than is used to derive a word meaning one who entertaios bhaktı for Mahārāja - P IV 3 97 mahārājāt than 11 The exact sense of the word mahārāja in this Sūtra is not clear It is suggested that mahārāja may here denote Kuberall or a Lokapāla in general10 Or, otherwise, on the strength of P IV 2 35 - mahārājaprostha. padát than - mahārāja is understood as some kind of divinity? It, is however, not improbable that, 19 P IV 3 97, the word, mahārāja, is used in a political sense and that bhakti, in that case, denotes loyalty
It may be noted that the meaning of the word bhakti ID connection with the three Sūtras - P IV 3 95-97 - discussed above (namely &lsquo;attachment&rsquo;, &lsquo;luking, loyalty&rdquo;) are more or less secular in character The Sūtra in this group, which is most crucial for our present purpose, is P IV 3 98 1āsuderarju

tion, as is generally the case with Patañjalı, is more pertinent Patañjal points out - and here we can do no better than depend on Patanjalı - that Vásudeva mentioned by Panini 10 IV 3 98 cannot be said to have been covered by IV 3 99 For, Vasudeva of P IV 3 98 18 not the name of any ordinary Ksatriya, but it is the name of the worshipful one &ldquo;I7 In other words, vāsudera of P IV 3 98 signifies the god Vásudeva as against any ordinary Ksatriya, named Väsudeva, who may be covered by the word ksatriya in P IV 3 99 Thus, according to Pánını, the word for the Bhakta of Vasudeva, the god, is to be derived by affixing the termination nun, while that for the Bhakta of Vasudeva, any ordinary Ksatriya, is to be derived by affixing the termination vun-though, eventually, the form and the accent of the so derived words may be the same 18
It may be pointed out that some editions of the MB read samiñar &lsquo;sā tatrabhagavatah for samjña&rsquo;sa tatrabhavatah The intention of P IV 3 98, namely, that asudeva mentioned in the Sutra is the name of a god is thereby made quite explicit Kaiyata also seems to accept that reading, for, his gloss reads nityah paramātmavisesa iha vasudevo gihjate It would, however, seem that tatrabhagavatah was a deliberate emendation of tatrabhavatah The critical edition of the MB by KIELHORNIP leaves no doubt about this Moreover, the occurrence of tatra in tatrabhagavatah is rathar strange It is also to be remembered that in most cases where the word bhagavat occurs in the MB, it refers to Pānını 20
That the word tatrabhavat, in this context, implies divinity can be safely presumed 21 It is used in opposition to the word ksa triya, tatrabharat here denotes one who is different from a Kșa triya He (that is, tatrabhajan) may be a &lsquo;worshipful&rsquo; Ksatriya

Qon-bonjo&rsquo; or * divde&rsquo; and human&rsquo; P IV 399, which men trous ksatriya without suggesting any distiaction between or dinary&rsquo; and Worshipful', rales out the first alternative It may also be noted, up this connection that Patanjal uses the word tatra bharat without any substantie The second alternative also 13 verdered nugatory in view of the fact that Patañjali hardly ever croplays the word räsudera as the tage of a person belonging to a social order other than Ksatrya* We have therefore to assume that ratrabhavan Väsudeva (mentioned in P IV 3 98) 13 a god and is to be distinguished from a Ksatnya whose name night be Vasudeva and who could then be covered by P IV 3 99 It may be, tacidentally, added that Vasudeva, when coupled with Arjuna, usually denotes a god
It is, howeser, not intended to be suggested that wherever the word tatrabharat occurs in the Bit refers to a god The word occurs fourteen times in the VB In all these contexts, except three, the substantives qualified by farrabhasat are specifi cally mentioned in the three passages, which represent the exception, tatrabharat is not followed by any substantive, that is to say, it is itself used in the sense of a substantive Two of these three passages, namely, commentanes on Þ IV 2 25 and P IV 3 98, read samjhau &lsquo;sā tatrabhadiah P IV 2 25 kasyer-explains, among other thogs, the form haya in the sense of something whose diyzpty is Ka or Prapata2 The question is there posed regarding the call which the Adbvaryn is required to give out in coppection with the Puronovākya relating to the offering to Ka (kājam harih) should it be

kasmai anubrühi (on the assumption that hāyam presupposes the adesa to kım) or kaja anubrīlu ( on the assumption that ka is an independent word)? Pataõjalconcludes that, in either case, the call should be hasmai anubrüh with the pronominal dative hasmai) for, he argues with rather queer logic, both him and ka are saryanāmas-him because it is a pronoun, and ha because it is the nama (name) of sarra (that is, Prajāpatı) Continuing, Patanjali alludes to another view on the subject and ends with the statement, samjñā cai &lsquo;sā tatrabharatah What is relevant to our present purpose is that the word tatrabhavat ( used by itself) in this statement clearly denotes a god, that is, Prajāpati The context permits no doubt about this whatsoever One would, therefore, be fully justified in inferring that, in an exactly similar statement in the commentary on P IV 3 98 also,24 the word tatrabha at denotes a god This would then support our earlier contention that vasudeva in P IV 3 98 is the game of a god The godhead of Vasudeva and Vasudevison or the religion centering round Vasudeva (which has to be regarded as the primary form of the classical Vaisnavism ) must have become fairly well established in Pānini&rsquo;s time (5th century BC) indeed, so much so that Panini thought it necessary to compose a special Sūtra 18 respect of them
It may be presumed that the popular religion with its cult of Bhakti, which had been reduced to a kind of torpidity on account of the increasingly pervasive influence of the Vedic Aryan religion, became re-animated, as it were, as the vitality of the Vedic religion began to diminish, and an aspect of it emerged in the form of Vāsudeyism and, as we have seen, became a dominant force already in Panini&rsquo;s time the tradition of the supreme godhead of Vasudeva and of Vasudevism has been continuous ever since that time Megasthenes (4th century B C ) speaks of the people of Sūrasena who held Heracles (by whom Megasthenes obviously meant Vasudeva-Krsna ) in special veocration 28 The

Bhagavadgitá (3rd century BC) eulogises the man of know ledge, who, at the end of several births, betakes himself unto the Lord in the conviction &quot; Vasudeva is All&rdquo; (VII 19) We then have the Bespagar inscription, belonging to the last quarter of the second century BC, on the Garudadhvaja of Vasudeva, the god of gods, erected by Heliodoros, the Bhagavata, the son of Dion and an whabitant of Taksasila
We have seen that Patañjalı has characterised Vásudeva of P IV 3 98 as tatrabhavar and has thereby isolated him from any Ksatriya whose name may be Vasudeva But there is a well Attested tradition that the god Vasudeva himself origioally belonged to the Ksatriya family of the Vrsnis in this context, one may just remind oneself of the Lords statement in the Bhagavadgitā, gamely * Of the Vrsais, I am Vasudeva &quot; (X 37) This tradition is confirmed also by the MB Commenting on the seventh Vārttika24 of P IV I 114,27 Patañjalı relates Vasudeva to the Vrsni family orsayano &lsquo;lakásah vasudevah bāladevah That, bere, the divide Vasudeva is intended becomes clear from his association with Baladeva 2 Sankarsana was a well-known Vrsni prince (who too was deified), and inscriptions closely ally Vasudevi with him thereby implying that Vasudeva also was a Vrsni prince who was later deified 29 Thus the Ghosundi stone Lascription of king Sarvatata, belonging to the second half of the first century BC, weations the construction of a stone eaclosure, called Nārāyana-vátaka, for the place of worship of the gods Samkarsana and Väsudeva Similarly, homage is paid to Samkarsada and Väsudeva in the Nanaghat cave inscription of the Sātavāhana queen Nāgapikā of the first century BC The Kasıkā emphasises this close relationship between Samkarsana 20d Vasudeva by giving the example, dvandvam sankarsana vasudevau, to illustrate the first Vārttıka of P VIII 1 15, namely,

atjantasahacarite lolajñāte diandam iry upasamh hjänam From all this, coupled with P IV 3 98 as explained above, onc may, Indeed, presume that Vasudeva of the Vrsais had been deified and made into the supreme god of Vasudevism already before Pánını&rsquo;s time
Incidentally, a reference may be made in this contert to the fact that there had been several Ksatriya princes who bore the name Vasudeva, but that it was only the Vrai prince Vasudeva who was derfied and became the supreme god of Vasudevism Traditional legends are narrated of Vasudeva, king of Pundralas, and Väsudeva, ling of Karavirapura, each of whom claimed to be the true divine Vasudeva but whose claim was entirely nullified by the powers of Vasudeva Krsna of the Vrsnis 30
Though the religion centering round the popular god Visu deva had become well established since before Panini&rsquo;s time, it 15 strange that the Buddlust canonical text Amguttaranılāja, which mentionsal such religious sects as the Ājivikas, the Nirgranthas, the Mundasrāvakas, etc, does not refer to the Vasudevalas Similarly, Aloka&rsquo;s inscriptions, which mention the Sramanas, the Brāhmanas, the Ājivikas, and the Nirgraothas, do not speak of the Väsudevalas The only possible explanation of this would be that Vasudevism, which was naturally restricted to the regions dominated by its chief promoters, namely, the Vrsors, the Sátvatas, and the Yadavas-Ābhiras, had not till then spread far towards Eastern India which was the provenance of Buddhism On the other hand, it was well known to Pánını of Taksasia as also to Megasthenes, and it is also seen to have attracted, 10 course of time, even foreigners like Heliodoros It may be further noted that the Middesa works (1st century BC), which,

though of the nature of commentaries, share the authority of the Pali canon, allode to various religious sects among which are Jocluded the worshippers of Vasudeva and Baladeva So far as Jainism is concerned, it seems to have been more positively responsive to Väsudeyism The Vasudeva-legends have markedly influenced the Jaina hagiology, particularly its concept of risasti dalakāpurusay wbo comprise, among others, Dipe Vasudevas, AC Baladevas, and gine Prativasudevas
Another striking fact regarding the Vasudeva religion is that the word vasudevcha, in the sense of a Bhakta of Văspdeva, 15 aot attested to any available literary work. On the other hand, since a descriptre grammarjao like Panini has devoted a separate Sutra to the morphological erplanation of that word, it must have been very much in vogue in his time we are, therefore, constrained to assume that considerable iterature of non-Vedic characters existed in Pangi s tinde bat that it is now lost to us 2 Attention tray be drawn to still another point which is important for the history of Vaisnatic Punini impliedly speaks of a religious sect the main feature of which was bhaku of Vasudeva On the other hand, he does pot allade to Vaisdavin either directly or indirectly It would, therefore, seems that the basic clement of what has now come to be known as VarnaVIS I was the Vasudeva religion, In other words, the starting point of what we today understand by Vasnavism was not Visnu but Vasudeva The term vasudevala must, accordingly, be regarded as having been much older than the terra vaisnava.
P IV.3 98 implies that, besides the Vasudeva-religion, there also existed, in Paninis time, a religious sect centering round Arjuna. The word for the Bhakta of Arjuna the god was, according to P.IV 3 98, to be derived by affixing the terming tion run to the word arruna - it was arrunaka, the word for the

Bhakta of a Ksatriya called Arjuna was, on the other hand, to be derived by affixing the termination vun (P IV 399)- it was orjunaka However, unlike the Vāsudeya religion, the religious history of India knows hardly anything of the Arjuna-religion It is suggested that the Arjunāyanas mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar inscription of Samudra Gupta were the followers of the Arjuna-cult 35 This cannot be accepted For one thing, if they were really the devotees of the divine Arjuna, according to P IV 3 98, they should have been called Arjunakas and not Arjunāyanas Secondly, the context in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription makes it quite clear that the Arjunāyapas are repre sented there essentially as a socio-political entity rather than a religious one It is more likely that the tribe of the Arjunāyanas was so called because it claimed descent from the Pandava hero Arjuna 36 The grammatical form of the word arjunājana would also confirm this 37 Another suggestion is that P IV, 3 98 does not presuppose two independent religious sects - one of the Vásu. devakas and the other of the Arjunakas - but that the Sūtra refers to one single religious sect with Vasudeva as the supreme god and Arjuna as the special devotee Obviously, this suggestion runs counter to the essential trend of that Sutra
We have to acquiesce in the fact that, in Panini&rsquo;s time, there did prevail two independent religious cults, namely, the Vāsudeva cult and the Arjuna cuft Further, from the manner in which they have been referred to by Pānını, it may be assumed that these two cults were closely allied to each other - the Vásu deva-cult having been regarded, even at that time, as being superior to the Arjuna-cult 38 Io the Rgvedic mythology, Vişğu is closely associated with Indra 3) According to Satapatha

Brahmana II 1 2 11 and V 4 3 7, Arjuna is a secret or mystical (guhya) dame of lodra, while, in later Vaistavism, the persona lity and character of Vedic Visou have been merged into those of Vasudeva. Therefore, the alliance between the two independent religious cults, namely, the Vasudeva cult and the Arjuna-cult, with which Pānını seems to have been familiar, may be sad to correspond, in a way, with the alliance between the two indepen dent divities of the Rgvedic mythology, namely, Visou and Indra. Another prototype of such an allunce betiveer two independent religious cults is to be seen in the religious ideology pertaining to Nara and Nārāyana, 4 wherein Nara may be regarded as the alter ego of Indra ( of the Rgveda ) and Arjuna (of P IV 3 98) and Nārāyana of Vuou ( of the Rgveda) and Vasudeva (of P IV 398) It would seem that, out of the two religious cults respectively centering round Vasudeva and Arjuna, the Vasudeva-cult, which was already regarded as the more dominant cult, soon subdued and submerged within itself the Arjuda-cult That is why we do not find any traces of thus latter cult either 10 history or in literature
The classical Vaspavism, with which one is generally familiar, is a kind of amalgam principally of four, ongipally independent, religious elements respectively embodied 20 the personalities of the four divinities, namely, Vasudeva, Krsna, Visau, and Nārāyana The identification of Krsos with Vasudeva, which constituted perhaps the most vital stage in this process of amalga mation, seems to have already been an accomplished fact - Indeed, of long standing - in Patañjali&rsquo;s time The two names, Vasudeva and Krsna, occur in the MB almost as synonyms For instance, while Vasudeva is said to have kiled Kins1, jaghang kamsam kıla vasudevah ( commentary on P III 2 111), Kroa is represented as having a grudge against his maternal unde

(Kamsa ) - asādhur mātule krsnah (commentary, some editions, on Vārttika 2 of P II 3 36) More convincing still is Patasijali&rsquo;s commentary on Vārttika 15 of P III i 26, where the words krşng and 1āsudeva occur in the same context as the names of one and the same divide being cifresu katham/ citresy apy udgūrni nipattaś ca prahārā dršjante hamsasya ca krsnasya ca/ kecil kamsabhaltā bhavantı kecid sāsudevabhak täh &rsquo;s Reference bas already been made to the close association of Vasudeva and Samkarsana as evidenced both by literature and inscriptions While commenting on Värttika 22 of P IT 2 24, Patadjali quotes, by way of illustration, a verse-half wherein Samkarsana is repre sented as being associated with Krsna in exactly the same manner: samkarsanadvilisasja balam krsnasya vardhatām
As regards the relationship between Vasudeva and Krsna, the view is sometimes put forth that Kisna was the original god, that Krşna and Vasudeva were not separate divide entities, and that Vāsudeva was just the patronymp of Kțşna derived from bis father&rsquo;s name Vasudeva Several objections can be raised against this view Firstly, the commentary on Värttika 7 of P IV 1 114 indicates that Vasudeva, and not Vasudeva,4* is the basic (underived) form of the name and that the termination an affixed to this original Dame Vasudeva also gives the forma asudeva Secondly, if Vasudeva was really a patronym, Baladeva or Sam karsana, who is represented as the elder brother of Krsna, should have been more aptly called Vasudeva But that is hardly ever the case On the other hand, we find Krsna and Baladeva being specifically referred to by their matronyms, namely, Devakiputra and Raubineya respectively The rivalry among some Ksatriya princes for the real divine * Võsudevahood,&quot; to which a reference has been made above, also clearly goes against Vasudeva being regarded as a patronym JACOBI has drawn attention to the following etymology of the word vasudeva given in the Mahā.

The main course of cvents, which eventually culminated 10 the identification of Vasudeva and Krso seems to have been something like this The religious ideology, with bhakti of Vasu deva – the Vrsar prioce who had come to be regarded as a god - as its central theme, must have arisen at a fairly early time so as to become thoroughly well established in the days of Pānın (5th Century BC) Perbaps a Jitle later than Vasudevism, another religious sect grety round the figure of Krsoa, who had ongoally been the tribal hero and religious leader of the Yādavas Thuis Yadava Krsna may as well have been the same as Devakīputra Krsna who is represented, in the Chandogja-Upanisad III 17 1, as a popul of Ghora Angirasa 54 and who is said to have learnt from his teacher the doctrice that man&rsquo;s life is a kind of sacrifice The chronological evidence does cot go against such assumption, if at all, it supports at Be that as it may, Krsoa must be said to have developed his own special philosophy of ufe, the main tenets of which were lokasamgraha and renunciation in action rather than of action 51 When, in course of time, the -Yrsnis and the

Yādavas, who were already related to each other, came closer together, presumably for political reasons, the personalities of Vrsai Vasudeva and Yadava Krsna were merged into each other so as to give rise to the new supreme god, Bhagavan Vāsudeva. Kęsna This must have happened not long after Panini&rsquo;s time In the nety legends, Väsudeva came to be interpreted as the patronym of Krsna Some Vasudeva came to be regarded as Krsna&rsquo;s fathers and the Vrsni Samkarsana-Baladeva as his elder brother in course of time, a third religious ideology, namely, the one which centered round Gopāla Krsna and which was presumably sponsored by the pastoral Abhiras, came to be engrafted on the organically combined Vásudeva-Krsna religion The teachings of Bhagavān Vāsudeva-Krsna were soon consolida ted and embodied in a popular religio philosophical text This text was later interpolated, obviously after suitable modifications, into the bardic-historical poem, Jaya, in the form of the Bhagavad gitã, whereby it served as the coraerstone of the superstructure which transformed the Jaya into the Bharata 53
In Patanjali&rsquo;s time, Vasudeva ( or rather Vasudeva-Krsna) had already become a religio legendary figure He had come to be regarded as having belonged to a remote past P. III 2 111 - anadyatane lan - explains the use of the imperfect tense The
52 Vasudeva is obviously an artificial back formation from Vasudeva Though Jacob does not subscnbe to the view that Vasudeva was the patronym of krna, he says that the ctymologically correct name should be Vasudeva (op af, p 165 ) Sukurnar SEN points out (SP, 14th AIOC, P 103) that vasu and Dusu arc respectively the normal and the lengthened grades of JE wey Therefore, according to him, Vasudeva - Vasudeva JACOBI mentions the case of Narasimha Nurasimha (op al p 164) Incidentally, JACOBI suggests (op al, P 163 ) that the garde of hrida y father was Anakadundubhi ( Bl II 30 12, III 21 7, XVI 7 1, Harmathsa 24 15 16 ) Another typo. thesis may be suggested in connection with this whole problem of ropa Vasudeva and Yadava kruna were two distinct personalities, Vasudeva could as well have been the name of Yadava krina • father knpa would then bc Yadava (tribal name) as well as Vasudeva (patronyo) The merger of Vrie Vasudeva and Yadava Vasudeva krpa might have been facilitated by the common clemncnt Vasudeva

Second Varttika of that Sutra - parolse ca lolchijfāte prafoktur darśar.Avisoje - prescribes that, with reference to a well-known erent which has happened out of one&rsquo;s sight but which one could have seen, one should use the operfect tense (lan) and not the perfect (Int) Here, Patialgses the etample, crwad jararah säletam 54 The historically sell-LQOWD siege of Saketa by the Yavana as a contemporaneous event in Patanjali&rsquo;s time Though a person belongiog to that period may not have actually seed it, in view of its contemporaneity, he could have witnessed st. Therefore he uses the imperfect tense form, crurat As a counter-example, Patanjali mention Joghāra homsor kila rasy derah. The Killing of Kamsa by Vásudeva was an event which was parokso that is, su buch had bappened out of one s sight) and lokarijrata (traditionally well-known ), but which was proroktuh adarsanarisara (that is, bich was so accept that it was not and could not have been seen by the speaker) Therefore, with reference to that event, the speaker had to use the perfect tense and not the imperfect tense Thas, uo Patzāli&rsquo;s time, the killing of Kamsa by Vasudeva had already become a houry or legendary event, an event of the remote past.
Further evidence to this connection is provided by Patzõpu&rsquo;s commentary on P III 126 - Fetman ca - 20d its Vārtikas I be subject discussed therein is the use of the causal Vārtika 6 of that Sutra, namely, akhjärāt krtas tad icasta i krhlprokrit pratjāpartih prohrtrice ca lāralan, tells us that ric (that is, the termination aya) should be appended to a verbal aonn expressive of an eveot 10 the sease of narrating that event &ldquo;The derivative suffix is to be dropped, the noun reduced to the form of the ongidal root from which it is derived, and it is to this root that

the termination aja is to be appended ” By way of illustration, Patañjali says that, according to this Vārttika, the statement kamsam glātayatı would mean that one narrates the event of the kıllıng of Kamsa and the statement balım bandhayatı would mean that one parrates the event of the confinement of Balt Then, in his commentary on Vārttıka 7 - ākhyānac ca prati sedhah - Patan jalı poses the question is this rule applicable only in respect of the traditionally well knowo legends like the Kamsa-vadha or is it applicable also in respect of any pormal everyday happening whereby răjānam āgamajan may be used in the sense of rājāgama nam ācaste $6 We may not go into the details of this whole discussion For our present purpose it is enough to note that Patañjalı regards the killing of Kamsa and the confinement of Balı as traditionally well-established legendary eveots
In his commentary on Vārttika 15- kuriarah prayojaka iti cet tulyam - Patañjalı raises another question which is of great interest from various points of view The wausal forms glātajan and bandhayatı in the foregoing illustrations are of the present tense, while the events of Kamsa-vadba and Bait-bandha belong to a remote past How can these two things be reconciled ? Patañjalı explains the propriety of the present tense in this context in the following mapper the statement kamsam ghātaj at means (accor ding to Vārttika 6 ) that one conveys to others the information regarding the event of the killog of Kamsa This one can do 10 three ways-(a) through the presentation of that event on the stage or (b) by depicting the event pictorially or (c) by means of a direct narration So far as the stage presentatio0 is concerned, the producers of the play create the illusion, before our very eyes, of the actor playing the role of Krsna actually killing the actor play ing the role of Kamsa 67 Thus the present tense ghātayatı is quite appropriate in that context $8 Even in a picture, the artist

depicts the scene of the killing of Kamsa, with all the hits and blows of Kamsa and Krsoa in such a way that one feels as if the whole event is taking place in oce&rsquo;s very presence 5 Then there are the Paurānikas - Patañjalı uses the word granthika a hich Kaiyata explains as Kathaka (narrator) Through their remarkable narra. trve skill they make the episode of Kansa-vadha Live before their large audiences By means of suitable modulation of voice, often accompanied by corresponding gesticulation, they succeed in rousing the dormant emotions of their hearers, some of whom Spbconsciously sympathise with Kamsa and some with Vāsudera. And these their emotions then become manifest on their faces So, here too, the present tense is legitimate Patanku further adds that, in connection with this last, one actually finds all the three tenses being used One may say “Go to the Paräna Session, Kamsa 15 being Luled (that is, the Paurānik1 is just at the point of narratiog the killing of Kamsa)&rdquo; Or&rsquo; Go to the Porāna-session, Kamsa will soon be killed (that is, the Paurānika will soon commence the narration of the killing of Kansa) &quot; Or What is the use of attending the Purana-session LON? Kamsa is already killed (that is, the Pauranika has already finished the narration of the Killing of Kamsa)&rdquo;
A reference may be made here to certain incidental points which have emerged from this portion in Patanjali&rsquo;s commeotary on Vārttika 15 of P. III 1 25 KETTH thinks that the passage Je rāvad ere fobhanıkā nāma contains the first mention of drama in Indian literature&rsquo; The word sobhanıla does not occur anywhere else 15 Sanskrit uterature Its meaning, namely,

producer of a drama&rsquo; (see above), is, therefore, more or less conjectural It is suggested that Sobhanika may be a misreading for Saubhika or saubhika 6 But lexicons explain saubhika or saubhiha as juggler' or &lsquo;conjurer'65 In that case, the present passage may be understood as alluding to a puppet-show, where the artist has to manipulate or juggle with the puppets, rather tban to a dramatic performance Or does it imply the drama producer&rsquo;s conjuring up an illusion of reality 260
KEITH also seems to have misunderstood the passage regarding the granthikas 67 He speaks of them as if they were performers of drama According to him, the granthikas divided themselves into two parts, one representing the followers of Kamsa with blackened faces, the other those of Krsna with red faces, and they expressed the feeling of both parties throughout the struggle from Krsna&rsquo;s birth to the death of Kamsa 68 He further adds &ldquo;The mention of the colour of the two parties 15 most significant red man slays black man the spirit of spring and summer prevails over the spirit of the dark winter 169 All this is patently farfetched The word granthika clearly denotes a narrator or a Pauranıka 70 The words, sabdagadumatram and Vācaksānäh, occurring in this context render this quite certain Again, the passage, Lecit kamsabhaktă bhavantı , does not refer to the granthikas dividing themselves into two parties It rather hints at the differing subconscious sympathies (bhakn) of the bearers, on account of which they are described as being vyāmisra
The Paurānikas, as true artists, rouse the emotions born out of these ionate sympathies (buddhivisajan prakāśay ann ) 71 These emotions then become manifest through the colours of the faces

One more point. Accordiog to WEBER (15 13, p 491 ), the fact that, in Patanjali&rsquo;s commentary on Virttikt 6 of P III I 26, the episodes of Kams3-vadha ( of which Kr502 is the bero) and the Bali-bardha (of which Visao b the tero) bave been reo tiored together is significant Though it may not prove that Krsoa *as identical with 1500, it does show that Krai and Visor stood io close relationship with each other &quot; It would however, seem that, though there is no clear adication is te VB that Krsd3 was identified with viszu, the identification must bare occurred much before Patasali s time Apart from the facts that Kro is called Kesava in Pataralis commertary op P II 23 and that Vāsudeva is referred to as Janīrdana in his commentary on P.

The legends relating to Vasudeva-Krsna occur in the Buddhist,&rdquo; the Jaina,and the Hindu literary texts There is every reason to presume that, apart from the Mahābharata, there existed in Patañjali&rsquo;s time some Kavyas of the classical type glori fying Vasudeva Krsna and his exploits Indeed, Patañjali has derived many of his illustrations from such Kavyas #o lo the context of the discussion regarding the Bahuvrihi compound, Patañjali, in his commentary on Varttika 22 of P II 2 24, poses the questiop as to why, in the verse-half samkarsanadvitiyasya balam hrsnasja vardhatām, the compound samkarsanadyja, and, in the verse-quarter asıdvitiyo &lsquo;nusasāra pāndavam, the compound asıdviriya should not take the dual number in accor dance with the rule dvajor dynacanam, and answers it by pointing out that the second member of those Bahuvrihi compounds, namely, dva, is to be understood in the sense of sahāya (com panion or helper) so that the question of twoness&rsquo; does not arise at all Leaving aside the grammatical point which Patañjalı has made here, we may only note what is relevant to our present purpose, namely, that Patañjali must have been familiar with a Kávya (or kāvyas ) - now, unfortunately, not available to us - dealing with Vāsudeva-Krsna and the Pandavassi from which he

P. 2. 34-alfăctaram - lays down the rule that the word Absch has a smaller number of syllables should be made the first member of a Dvandva compound. In connection with the dis cussion as to whether this rule is to be made applicable specifi cally to a Dvandva compound consisting of two members only (as is indicated by tara), Patazjali quotes the two verse-quarters to the promānikā netre, mrdangasarhhatūraråh prthan nadanti Samsadi, and one verse-quarter in the praharsini metr dharapatiramakesarānām (where the words ráma and keśava respectively denate Samkarsana-Balarama and Vasudeva-Krsda), the Dyandra compounds in which, namely, mrdangasankharinarah and Thanapatıramaheśarānām, apparently show that the rule alpactaram is not applicable to Drandva compounds bang more than two members. Of course, Patañjal has his own explanation of this Incidentally, it may be pointed out that these verse quarters are understood by some scholars as belonging to one and the same contest, namely, the playing of musical instruments in festivals celebrated in the temple of Dhanapati-Răma-Keśava ** This does not, however, seem to be correct. The words samsadi and prāsāde clearly indicate tro different contexts, so too perhaps do the two different metres It may be further added that archaeologists have so far pot come across any temple dedicated Jointly to Kubera, Balarāma, aod Krsna In some editions of the UB, asādhur mätule krsrah- &amp; verse-quarter in the sloka metre from some kávya - 15 quoted to illustrate Vārttika 2 (sodhasa dhuprajoge ca) of P II 3 36 (saptamy adhikarane ca) A

in the inscriptions of about that period, such as those of Ghosundi and Nanaghat,87 Samkarsana is given precedence over Vasudeva, while in the Vyüha-doctrine he is represented as being subordinate to Vasudeva It is, therefore, presumed that the Vyüba-doctrine toast not have been consolidated at the time of those inscriptions As also of Patanjal: It is, however, not improbable that the religious ideology in which Samkarana was superior to Vāsu deva was quite independent of the Vyüha-doctrine, and that the two ideologies prevailed contemporaneously The sorsdip of Samkarsana representing an independent religious sect must have been quite popular in early times 68 Presumably it arose more or less contemporaneously with Vasudevism, but it seems to have had a restricted sphere of influence One development in the religious history of that period was that the two independent religions, namely, the Samkarzana-religion and the Vasudeva-religion, came to be closely allied with each other the precedence in that alliance having been apparently gnen to Samkarsana ? Actually the two religious sects must have merged together on terms of equality Sankarsana was mentioned first only formaly, and that because he happened to be the elder one of the two Vrsai priaces who had been deified However, it was the Vasudeva-religion which became more dominant un course of time * The other develop ment, perhaps independent of the first, was in the direction of the
(Carlosed from the last page) doctrine of Vyühas, but that Visudeva-Krsda is called fanārdana i tu Passages in it (L. 36, I 39 T44 III 18 YT 51) Inadentally, Rāma, Laksmana, Bharata, and Satrughna are regarded as the four forms of the supreme god Rāma.
