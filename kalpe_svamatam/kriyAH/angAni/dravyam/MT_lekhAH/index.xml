      <description>varAhamihira was a Hindu encyclopedist who lived in the 500s of the CE era. He may have descended from a family of shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas, as suggested by the mihira epithet in his name combined with varAha. This is also suggested by his tendencies for solar-system worship which appears to have been a trait of the shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas or Iranian Hindu brahmins. He covers an extraordinary range of topics in his encyclopedic works ranging from astronomy, mathematics, rituals, yavana jAtaka-s, augury, sooth-saying of various kinds, and worship of Hindu gods through idols.</description>

      <description>IE Times Many hold that there might have been a common ancestral IE ritual girdle or upper garment. While this is possible we don&amp;rsquo;t have preservation of a certain crucial branches to to say muich. The the band on the special upper toga of the Roman flamen dialis called toga praetexta and the special apron worn over it called the limes suggests that indeed there was some ancient IE ritual vesture that eventually evolved into the girdle or yaj~nopavIta.</description>
