      <description>Both the avaykta and the nR^isiMha-tApini explain that the yantra with the ugra viShNu formula should be tied as an amulet. The nR^isiMha-tApini explains the structure of the great yantra of viShNu that simultaneously encompasses :1) the bIja of nR^isiMha and the praNava. 2) the sudarshana chakra mUla mantra. 3) the nArAyaNa aShTAkSharI 4) the vAsudeva dvAdashAkSharI 5) the ShoDasha mAtR^ika bIja-s 6) the ugra viShNu formula. The formal worship of the yantra and viShNu embodied in it may be done thus.</description>

      <description>Late in the evening the my clansmen and me left by an uncomfortable bus journey through the drAviDa country to the outpost of aunts N and H. Their clansmen had been killed by fiery abhichAras of their shatrus, but they took the help of our learned co-ethnic, a master of the mantra-shAstra to save themselves. While in gavalakuNDa he was a student of the descendent of that great exponent of samaya-vidyA of the east.</description>
