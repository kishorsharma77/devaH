      <description>A number of archaic altars shapes existed for the agnichayana of which the practical geometric knowledge is largely lost in the surviving shrauta tradition.
The most famous which are still performed are: 1) the broad winged ShaDpatrika shyenachiti or the gliding eagle altar with 6 feathered wings. There is a variant of this with wings entirely made of 6 rows of parallelogram bricks.
2) the drawn wing pa~Nchapatrika shyenachiti or the diving eagle altar with 5 feathered wings.</description>

      <description>The pitR^imedha is a relatively obscure Aryan mortuary rite done an year or later after the death of an ancestor. It used to be performed in the height of summer, a new moon day or in the month of magha, usually choosing a nakShatra with a single star. The bones of the ancestor were brought in an urn and placed on a couch. The urn was wrapped in an unwashed cloth and the living descendents and their women folk go around the urn 3 times as the vINA and other musical instruments are played.</description>

      <description>The practioners of the fourth veda are dying creed. As we may be amongst the very last of the practioners and some who are learning it in a recent revival do not known of how the atharvaNa saMdhya needs to be done we provide some details. As this is a common question asked by the atharvan revivalists, with time I hope to provide a detailed protocol of atharvan saMdhya, atharvan upAkarma and some other important para-vedic rites of the atharvan-s like the skanda yAga or the dhUrta homa.</description>

      <title>Rules for ritual eligibility</title>

      <description>There is considerable debate about who is eligible for vedic rites. The shrauta sUtras, which are the authorities on the topic are quite clear about the matter, barring a few debatable points. kAtyAyana expounds these matters most clearly:
1.1.1 athAto.adhikAraH
Now we shall explain the eligibility for performing vedic rites.
1.1.2 falyuktAni karmANi
The rites are connected with specific results.
1.1.3 sarveShAMvisheShAt
Prima facie everyone is entitled vedic rites as no specification has been made in this regard.</description>

      <description>The shrauta sUtra of kAtyAyana and the pAraskara gR^ihya sUtra mention a peculiar rite namely the gardhabhejya or the donkey sacrifice. The context suggests that it is performed by a brahmachAri who has fallen to passion and had sex against the norms of a vedic student. The offerings were made into the unconsecrated fire with the puroDAsha cakes being cooked on the bare ground. The heart and the tongue and other parts of the donkey were offered into water.</description>

Ladies (ambA, ambAli and ambikA) no one seems to have sex with me. The bad horse is sleeping. That is the horse and you are the mare princess.
The princess says the following anuShTubh (one of the dialogs ):

      <title>The rite of the solsticial day</title>

      <description>The old solsticial rite of the Indo-Aryans is performed on the second last-last day of the year (mahAvrata). The description of the oldest version of the rite is seen in the pa~nchavimsha, aitareya and shA~NkhAyana brAhmaNa. The clearest explanations of the ritual actions are found in the shA~NkhAyana shruti. It appears to preserve some of the archaisms of the Proto-Indoeuropean form of the rite. It was literally round the clock and one requires considerable energy to perform it successfully.</description>

2) Then the yajur priests take fire around the 13 animal starting from the kapi~njala that are tied along with the stallion and then release them.
3) The horse is lead to a large piece of cloth spread on the ground on which a piece of gold is placed.</description>

      <description>The sarpasattra as per the itihAsa was the gory sacrifice of janamejaya pArIkshita done to avenge the death of his father parIkShit by the sarpas. The itihAsa states that the interaction between the pANDus, yadus and the sarpa-s was a long-standing and complicated one. arjuna first fathers a son irAvAn, through the sarpa princes ulUpI, the daughter of kauravya, the son of dhR^itarAshTra airAvata. kR^iShNa devakIputra defeats a sarpa king kali~nga according to the harivaMsha on the yamuna.</description>

      <description>The vratya stoma is described in the first 4 sections of the 17th chapter of the pa~nchaviMsha brAhmaNa. The stoma has been described as a means of admitting non-Aryans to the Aryan fold but this is not clear from the vedic text describing the rite. A summary of the brAhmaNa discourse is given below:
The vrAtya stoma’s frame tale goes thus. The devas went to svargo lokaH. The gaNas of the dreaded The god were left behind leading the life of vrAtyas.</description>

      <description>The Indo-Aryan kshatriyas performed a peculiar rite called the puruSha-medha that has been spoken of by Indians in hushed tones. Much like the cow sacrifice and horse sacrifice, which people have tried to explain away as not implying a real slaying, the human sacrifice has also been denied. However, there is really no point being coy about our past, based on modern notions and standards.
The puruSha-medha was a rare rite, as it finds very infrequent mention in Indic literature.</description>
