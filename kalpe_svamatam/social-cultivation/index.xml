      <description>Sexual deviance &amp;ldquo;The primary function of sex in eukaryotes is recombinogenic generation of diversity that evolved as response to the life-and-death pressures of biological conflicts. Hence, any sexual activity that does not satisfy this function is clearly either of secondary value or maladaptive or accidental(not significant).
Several instances of atypical sexual activity like svali~Ngamaithuna in various animals is simply accidental or the main function misfiring. In several primates, in particular the Homo-Pan clade sex has a secondary signaling value.</description>

      <description>See the guru page for notes on the role of a guru in self-cultivation.
Distributedness Within a tradition, such guru-s form a network. The degree of centralization or distribution varies accross traditions. This has consequences on the robustness of the tradition to various kinds of attacks.
(trika) kaula vs siddhAnta-shaiva case The below was presented by {MT}
Data  We may infer from shaiva exegetical texts that the whole of the shaiva-shAstra was held as authoritative at a general level: starting from the old pAshupata material down to the latest srotAMsi and their evolutes.</description>

      <description>Scholasticism, intellectual and sentimental life. The beauty and depth that is the dharmic civilization and traditions is considered elsewhere.
Consider the list of individual heroes involved in scholarly pursuit. Contributions were abundant in the fields of Psychology, philosophy and physical training (remember the yoga-Asanas and the many martial arts). &amp;ldquo;If we look at the old Hindu education system it clearly had a mechanism to fast-track scientific talent which the modern Indian system woefully lacks.</description>

      <description>Intro An incomplete understanding of the spectrum of Hindu ideals leads to many errors.
Social level failures Poverty  &amp;ldquo;Years ago I visited old agraharas in Mysore it was really bad in 1-2 bedroom small house, built during maharaja&amp;rsquo;s time entire family of purohitas lived. One thing I am glad my mother forced me away from full time vedapathashala to secular education early on.&amp;rdquo;  Individual level failures Health loss  This could be caused by fanatical ritual strictness.</description>

      <description>Indigenous subversions Many serious internal subversions arose motivated by:
 Opposition to the proven vaidika way. Opposition to varNAshrama dharma, and the special role of brAhmaNa-s in conserving Arya ideals.  Secularist and abrahamist subversion  As the mlecCha rag NYT put in 2017: &amp;ldquo;The tension between the hold of established cultural practices and new efforts by activists to safeguard rights, whether minority, individual or animal&amp;rdquo;. Encouraging schisms along the faultlines of the &amp;ldquo;suppressed and oppressed&amp;rdquo;.</description>
