      <description>Survival, thriving and competitive advantage  From the point of view of nature, in the context of competing cultural memes, the ultimate value of dharma memeplex is the fitness benefit it provides to the society. In all likelihood, as the wise have noted (20151212), it was this memeplex (esp: notion of dharma, shAstra-s and a strong brahma-kShatra social system) that was instrumental in its votaries sweeping away and dominating all resistance across vast swathes of geography and time; while assimilating and adapting new entrants and peripheral practices of other pagans.</description>

      <title>Dharma Today</title>

      <description>Circumstance and relevance  The motivations described earlier still drive us today, and we must do our best to imbibe the spirit (not the letter) of the classical dharmashAstra thought and refine ourselves as individuals and communities. Hindu culture and civilization is facing an existential threat.  &amp;ldquo;But it has a dangerous rival – a memetic complex of a pathogenic type that arose in the Afro-Asiatic milieu of West Asia. This rival is the one which has extinguished the system across the former IE world and taken up the riches generated by the IE system as its “secular” property.</description>

      <title>Fluid dharma</title>

      <description>Fluidity while retaining core principles Indian notions of dharma was very fluid. (../For a general context on the limits of codification and holy books, see here.)
 Notes  PV kANe&amp;rsquo;s notes on fluidity: 1, 2,3, 4, 5. RB15.    Principles   The explicitly and implicitly stated motivations of dharma (../such as accomplishing comfort/ sukha of everyone in order to retain one&amp;rsquo;s comfort - quotes in this page) naturally enable people to redetermine the details of what constitutes dharma &amp;ldquo;from first principles&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Sources of the dharma include the veda-s, itihAsa-s, purANa-s, the vedAnga called kalpa (which includes dharmasUtra-s, smRtis, dharmashAstra-s and their commentaries). General intro to valid sources of hindu knowledge here. These sources are classifified into shruti (veda-s), smRti texts and shiShTAchAra (practice of learned elders).  All of these are ultimately said to derive from the veda-s in some traditions - hypothesizing lost veda-s and brAhmaNa-s in the process.   Among the smRti-s  manu-smRti and yAJNavalkya-smRti were the most important classically (going by the number of commentaries).</description>
