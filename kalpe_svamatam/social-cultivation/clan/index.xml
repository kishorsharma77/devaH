      <description>Intro Ethnic shifts provide important context for development of later social organizations.
Initial peopling  First came early hominids such as H.heidelbergensis from around 250,000-300,000 years BP. Indian hunter gatherers came next. Then the iranian-farmer-invasion Then, Aryan migration/ invasion Then, Austro-Asiatic incursion dravidian-bloom Great Indo Aryan consolidations  Islamic invasions  Finally, during the Islamic invasions, we get some Turkik input. These seem to have left comparatively little genetic footprints even among muslims.</description>

      <description>Counters to western criticism of the caste system (FB15,) There is a fundamental problem here. The assumption that the &amp;ldquo;caste system&amp;rdquo; (not as you imagine it, but as it actually existed), was an inferior and immoral social system. This is a claim no one here seems to challenge, by which I presume that they&amp;rsquo;ve bought into it.
 &amp;ldquo;Caste system&amp;rdquo; was not a fair system (in many meanings of the word &amp;ldquo;fair&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>Justification for change  jAti-varNa system emerged as a social convenience, and hindu-s are free (and happy) to change it after the need for it has expired.  As shrI-golvAlkar said: &amp;ldquo;varNa-vyavasthA is a social vyavasthA, not an avasthA&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;The two occasions on which the Purusha Sukta is invoked in its first chapter there is a rider attached to it &amp;ndash; “for the sake of prosperity and flourishing in the worlds” in the first case (.</description>

      <description>Utility Pride in ancestral accomplishments can be a great motivator in one&amp;rsquo;s own life (especially when it comes to following dharma).
Examples &amp;ldquo;If brAhmaNa archaka-s serve in those village temples suffering paltry salaries lower than what the watchman or sweeper gets, it is because of kulAbhimAna and sense of hereditary duty than anything else. Were it not for this familial urge and pride, the shAkha-s of veda which have come down to us would not at all have survived.</description>
