      <description>Vaidika ideals The vaidika ideals (../deva-s, xAtra, dharma, brahman, yajna &amp;hellip; mentioned in the intro) easily lend themselves to the development of virile, yet harmonious and composite polytheistic rAShTra-s (states).
  The polycentric and adaptible vaidika ideals were quite acceptable to non-vaidika pagans.
  Further, the sheer sophistication of the continually developing vedAnga-s and kala-s were very attractive to vedic and non-vedic pagans alike.
  Ritualist conservative core  Conservation of core vaidika ideas over millennia and across genepool-shifts involved evolution of a well-developed and influential ritualist caste (brAhmaNa-s) with a powerful oral tradition and specifically a grammatical tradition that allowed preservation of the language, especially in ritual.</description>

      <description>Intro
 Were the Brahmins of Southeast Asia Brahmins? by Dick van der Meij  The main evidence in support of the idea that the brahmins of Southeast Asia were brahmins is that they were called so. Filliozat (1972: vii ) was suitably cautious in putting both &amp;lsquo;brahmin&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Hindu&amp;rsquo; within quotation marks: &amp;ldquo;En Thailande et au Cambodge il existe une communauté dite de &amp;lsquo;brahmanes&amp;rsquo;, spécialisée dans l&amp;rsquo;accomplissement de rites &amp;lsquo;hindous&amp;rsquo; dans les cérémoni es officielles.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Why is it so? Where have we, deeply orthodox, ritualistic, endogamous even 30 years ago, faltered so badly.&amp;rdquo;
Maladaption to modernity under pressure  &amp;ldquo;I believe this is part of the larger encounter of the v1s with modernity going bad. As the natural intellectual and to a degree strategic leaders of H society some v1s led the H in their last struggle against the mlechCha-s i.e. 1857CE and lost. In the case of the Kashmirian v1s there was the even earlier trauma of destruction of their world by the u3s.</description>

      <description>The below is from &amp;ldquo;An Empire of Books : The Naval Kishore Press and the Diffusion of the Printed Word in Colonial India by Ulrike Stark&amp;rdquo;:
In its complexity it reflects the fluid nature and flexibility of jāti and varņa norms prevailing during the first half of the century, while also illustrating the emergence of caste consciousness and a more homogeneous &amp;lsquo;caste society&amp;rsquo; in the second half. His story is in short that of a Dhusar turned Bhargava, involving a shift in varna affiliation from Kshatriya to Brahmin.</description>
