      <description>Early caste hindu support  Older history: see here. &amp;ldquo;Lokmanya Tilak once publicly declared that he would denounce even God if He accepted untouchability. Veer Savarkar had personally led the so-called untouchables into temples in order to eradicate the evil. Gandhiji vigorously carried forward the campaign against untouchability started by Tilak and Savarkar.&amp;rdquo; Those who agitated for abolition of untouchability and facilitated the passing of The Untouchability Offences Act in the year 1955, were all Hindus, mostly high-caste Hindus, not Christians, nor Muslims.</description>

      <description>As Conrad said: &amp;ldquo;India outside the alluvial plains was actually sparsely populated and those regions which didn&amp;rsquo;t generate a large agricultural surplus and was dominated by nomadic groups and hunter-gatherer groups were not subject to any sustained form of forced incorporation; they were largely left along, as long as they accepted the political suzertainty of the regional rulers - many Hindu rulers were happy to enter such agreements in return for military service during large scale campaigns; there was little effort to concertedly settle adivasi dominated areas or tax them; when this changed as under the Mughals and the British you had massive resistance.</description>
