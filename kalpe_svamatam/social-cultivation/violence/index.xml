      <title>Abortion</title>

      <description>The Dharmic texts enunciate how though Jiva is present within the mother from the time of conception, it enters the Hrdaya of the fetus only towards the fourth month of pregnancy. Hence, the fetus, which is a non-living matter becomes endowed with Jivahood only towards the end of the fourth month of pregnancy. Thus, only the abortion performed after the 16 weeks of pregnancy or after the Jiva enters the Hrdaya of fetus (which can be known from unique desires that mother develops), can be compared to a killing of person, while abortion before 16 weeks is just preventing Jiva from self-identifying with the fetus.</description>

      <description>Specially protected animals: cow, horse, man &amp;hellip; Optional cow and horse sacrifice exist, but are barred by the dharma-shAstra-s in the kali-yuga.  Context in conflict  The context of hindu-muslim conflict (with the latter using cow slaughter to stick it to the hindus - Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer [NG15-B]) makes cow protection a particularly important issue.  Visceral reactions are an essential expression of a strong Hindu cultural immune system.</description>

      <description>Vedic Animal sacrifices  pashuyAga-s  kapinjala-adhikaraNa of mImAmsa-shAstra is a classic illustration (where the question of how many kapinjala birds are to be sacrificed is considered). Certain compulsory पशुयाग-s (usually goat sacrifices) are required of agnihotri-s Eg: निरूढपशुबन्धः. [Note: Optional cow and horse sacrifice exist, but are barred by the dharma-shAstra-s in the kali-yuga.] Recent examples - DH16. gavAlambha / cow sacrifice is also referred to in the manu-smRti, and others (eg: as part of madhuparka).</description>

      <description>Ritual suicide of widows (including at the husband&amp;rsquo;s funeral pyre).
Terms and forms  &amp;ldquo;the Dharmashastras use a number of terms to refer to the ritual: “anugamana” (‘going after’), “sahagamana” (‘going with’), “anumarana” (‘dying after), “sahamarana” (‘dying with’), and “anvarohana” (‘mounting after). Even in popular usages, when the ritual is referred to as “satidaha”, “satipratha” or “sativrata”, the term Sati refers to the devoted wife, while the suffix describes the ritual aspect.</description>
