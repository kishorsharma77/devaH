title: (A)theism/ (a)dEvism?
---


The English word God may to a hindu mean either a deity ([dEvatA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_%28Hinduism%29)) or that which pervades everything ([brahman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman)) (both of which are distinct from the Abrahamist notion of a true God). This leads to confusion while talking to Hindus. Hindu-s have a stronger need (because of unique conditioning) for distinguishing deva from brahman compared to say Egyptians or Japanese. So, their tendency to take God to mean brahman is quite understandable.

This results in hindu-s confusingly (and to a certain extant, confusedly) identifying themselves as "monotheists" rather than polytheists, and calling their gods "demigods". This is misuse of an language (which is inadequate in the first place), given what these terms mean to others - like having to do arithmetic using the roman numerals rather than the hindu place-value numeric notation.

The latter is mostly uncontrovertial, so we deal with the fomer.  

Personal note: For all purposes practical to most atheists, I am an atheist (in that I don't believe in a god who orchestrates supernatural phenomena to answer prayers - since the laws of nature are sacred to the Gods); yet in nearly all ways which matter to most theists, I am a theist.
