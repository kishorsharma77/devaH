## Intro
- Objects of wonder are worthy "bodies" for the Gods - good portals to access them.
- kRShNa says in the exceptionally brilliant chapter 10 bhagavad-gItA, after identifying himself with a long series of awesome things (such as "दण्डो दमयतामस्मि नीतिरस्मि जिगीषताम्") : "यद्यद्विभूतिमत्सत्त्वं श्रीमदूर्जितमेव वा । तत्तदेवावगच्छ त्वं मम तेजोंऽशसम्भवम् ॥ ४१ ॥" - "All that is endowed with glory, grace, grandeur, has sprung from a mere flare of my radiance" (Dr. G L Krishna [here](http://www.sandeepweb.com/the-bhagavad-gita-before-the-battle/)). This is concordant with the hindu notion of divinity.
- "Āścaryavat paśyati kaścid enam, āścaryavad vadati tathaiva cānyaḥ | Āścaryavac cainam anyaḥ śṛṇoti, śrutvāpy enaṃ veda na caiva kaścit ||" (BG)
- To paraphrase GL kRShNa: The adoration of awesomeness includes adoration of glorious characters in our legends, the celebration of natural geography (the great rivers, the great mountains, etc. as centres of pilgrimage) and the adoration of sages (from Vyasa-Vishwamitra to Ramana-Ramakrishna).
- "The deities of heaven and earth that appear in the ancient texts and also the spirits enshrined in the shrines; furthermore, among all kinds of beings – including not only human beings but also such objects as birds, beasts, trees, grass, seas, mountains, and so forth"

## kAmi
– any being whatsoever which possesses some eminent quality out of the ordinary, and is awe-inspiring, is called kami. (Eminence here does not refer simply to superiority in nobility, goodness, or meritoriousness. Evil or queer things, if they are extraordinarily awe-inspiring, are also called kami.) (Norinaga, quoted in Matsumoto 1970:84)" \[- Wonderment and awe: way of kami [here](http://refractory.unimelb.edu.au/2004/02/03/wonderment-and-awe-the-way-of-the-kami-lucy-wright/)\]
