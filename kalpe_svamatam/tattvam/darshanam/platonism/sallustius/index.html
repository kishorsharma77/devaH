  <p>Some of the Hermetic sage Sallustius&rsquo;s views <a href="https://hermetic.com/texts/on_the_gods-1">p1</a>, <a href="https://hermetic.com/texts/on_the_gods-2">p2</a> are extremely valuable in understanding the deva-s. Sallustius was a friend of the revered Roman emperor Caesar Julian the Apostate, who tried but ultimately failed to restore deva-dharma and was murdered by a Christian. Below are some pertinent quotes from a translation by Gilbert Murray in Five Stages of Greek Religion.</p>
<h2 id="gods-are-unchanging-unbegotten-eternal">Gods are unchanging, unbegotten, eternal.</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Neither are they separate from the first cause nor from one another, just as thoughts are not separate from mind nor acts of knowledge from the soul.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gods-are-incorporeal-and-not-in-space">Gods are incorporeal, and not in space.</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;To say that these objects are sacred to the Gods, like various herbs and stones and animals, is possible to sensible men, but to say that they are Gods is the notion of madmen - except, perhaps, in the sense in which both the orb of the sun and the ray which comes from the orb are colloquially called &lsquo;the sun&rsquo;.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gods-are-effortless">Gods are effortless</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;All this care for the world, we must believe, is taken by the Gods without any act of will or labor. As bodies which possess some power produce their effects by merely existing: e.g. the sun gives light and heat by merely existing; so, and far more so, the providence of the Gods acts without effort to itself and for the good of the objects of its forethought.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="myths-and-images">Myths and images</h2>
<p>Summary: Myths are divine, are &ldquo;like the Gods&rdquo;, but are obviously not to be taken literally. They contain both commonly understandable declarations about the Gods and mysteries only understood by the wise. It&rsquo;s paradoxes and uncouth elements mean also to alert us that their words are veils.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Myths have been used by inspired poets, by the best of philosophers, by those who established the mysteries, and by the Gods themselves in oracles.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;(They) make the Gods well disposed to those who speak of them.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now the myths represent the Gods themselves and the goodness of the Gods&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;(Myths are) subject always to the distinction of the speakable and the unspeakable, the revealed and the unrevealed, that which is clear and that which is hidden: since, just as the Gods have made the goods of sense common to all, but those of intellect only to the wise, so the myths state the existence of Gods to all, but who and what they are only to those who can understand. &hellip; Besides, to wish to teach the whole truth about the Gods to all produces contempt in the foolish, because they cannot understand, and lack of zeal in the good, whereas to conceal the truth by myths prevents the contempt of the foolish, and compels the good to practice philosophy.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;They also represent the activities of the Gods. &hellip; Those who make the world are Zeus, Poseidon, and Hephaistos; those who animate it are Demeter, Hera, and Artemis; those who harmonize it are Apollo, Aphrodite, and Hermes; those who watch over it are Hestia, Athena, and Ares. One can see secret suggestions of this in their images. Apollo tunes a lyre; Athena is armed; Aphrodite is naked (because harmony creates beauty, and beauty in things seen is not covered).&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But why have they put in the myths stories of adultery, robbery, father-binding, and all the other absurdity? Is not that perhaps a thing worthy of admiration, done so that by means of the visible absurdity the soul may immediately feel that the words are veils and believe the truth to be a mystery?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Of myths some are theological, some physical, some psychic, and again some material, and some mixed from these last two.&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Socrates on the use of myth <a href="https://storify.com/EPButler/on-plato-phaedrus-229b-230a">here</a>: &ldquo;I accept what is customarily believed concerning them, and, as I was saying, I look not into them but into my own self: Am I a beast more complicated and savage than Typhon, or am I a tamer, simpler animal with a share in a divine and gentle nature?&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;May these explanations of the myths find favour in the eyes of the Gods themselves and the souls of those who wrote the myths.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="angering-and-pleasing-gods">Angering and pleasing gods</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It is impious to suppose that the divine is affected for good or ill by human things. The Gods are always good and always do good and never harm, being always in the same state and like themselves. The truth simply is that, when we are good, we are joined to the Gods by our likeness to live according to virtue we cling to the Gods, and when we become evil we make the Gods our enemies - not because they are angered against us, but because our sins prevent the light of the Gods from shining upon us, and put us in communion with spirits of punishment. And if by prayers and sacrifices we find forgiveness of sins, we do not appease or change the Gods, but by what we do and by our turning toward the divine we heal our own badness and so enjoy again the goodness of the Gods. To say that god turns away from the evil is like saying that the sun hides himself from the blind.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="origin-of-evil-no-positive-evil">Origin of evil; no positive evil.</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The Gods being good and making all things, how do evils exist in the world? Or perhaps it is better first to state the fact that, the Gods being good and making all things, there is no positive evil, it only comes by absence of good; just as darkness itself does not exist, but only comes about by absence of light.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Suppose it is said that there are evil spirits: - if they have their power from the Gods, they cannot be evil; if from elsewhere, the Gods do not make all things. If they do not make all things, then either they wish to or cannot, or they can and do not wish; neither of which is consistent with the idea of god. We may see, therefore, from these arguments, that there is no positive evil in the world.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is in the activities of men that the evils appear, and that not of all men nor always. &hellip; In the same way, because in a given place light does not exist, there comes darkness, which has no positive existence.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But if the adulterer thinks his adultery bad but his pleasure good, and the murderer thinks the murder bad but the money he gets by it good, and the man who does evil to an enemy thinks that to do evil is bad but to punish his enemy good, and if the soul commits all its sins in that way, then the evils are done for the sake of goodness. &hellip; The soul sins therefore because, while aiming at good, it makes mistakes about the good. &hellip; &quot;</li>
<li>&ldquo;And we see many things done by the Gods to prevent it from making mistakes and to heal it when it has made them. Arts and sciences, curses and prayers, sacrifices and initiations, laws and constitutions, judgments and punishments, all came into existence for the sake of preventing souls from sinning; and when they are gone forth from the body, Gods and spirits of purification cleanse them of their sins.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fortune">Fortune</h3>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;If fortune makes a wicked man prosperous and a good man poor, there is no need to wonder. For the wicked regard wealth as everything, the good as nothing. And the good fortune of the bad cannot take away their badness, while virtue alone will be enough for the good.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;But to attribute men&rsquo;s acts of injustice and lust to fate, is to make ourselves good and the Gods bad. Unless by chance a man meant by such a statement that in general all things are for the good of the world and for those who are in a natural state, but that bad education or weakness of nature changes the goods of Fate for the worse.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Souls are punished when they have gone forth from the body, some wandering among us, some going to hot or cold places of the earth, some harassed by spirits. Under all circumstances they suffer with the irrational part of their nature, with which they also sinned. For its sake there subsists that shadowy body which is seen about graves, especially the graves of evil livers.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="good-are-happy-both-living-and-dead">Good are happy, both living and dead</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Souls that have lived in virtue are in general happy, and when separated from the irrational part of their nature, and made clean from all matter, have communion with the gods and join them in the governing of the whole world. Yet even if none of this happiness fell to their lot, virtue itself, and the joy and glory of virtue, and the life that is subject to no grief and no master are enough to make happy those who have set themselves to live according to virtue and have achieved it.&rdquo;</li>
