      <description>Some of the Hermetic sage Sallustius&amp;rsquo;s views p1, p2 are extremely valuable in understanding the deva-s. Sallustius was a friend of the revered Roman emperor Caesar Julian the Apostate, who tried but ultimately failed to restore deva-dharma and was murdered by a Christian. Below are some pertinent quotes from a translation by Gilbert Murray in Five Stages of Greek Religion.
Gods are unchanging, unbegotten, eternal.  &amp;ldquo;Neither are they separate from the first cause nor from one another, just as thoughts are not separate from mind nor acts of knowledge from the soul.</description>
