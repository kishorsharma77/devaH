## स्वाभिप्रायः
- "Lindy test" इत्यनेन साधु यत्किञ्चिद् वेदोक्तम्।
- अस्मत्पूर्वजास् तदा जयिष्णवः पराक्रमिण आसन्न् इति वेदानाम् अनुसरणयोग्यतां ख्यापयति।

## mImAmsaka-s
- "No argument - just take it as an axiom." (svataḥprāmāṇya) \[[Jayanta-KK12](http://www2.lit.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kkataoka/Kataoka/FreschiKataoka2012.pdf)\]
- "Mīmāṃsakas divide in fact what can be known into two precincts, on the one hand common experience, which encompasses what can be known through sense-perception and the other instruments of knowledge (inference, analogy and cogent evidence, to which Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā authors add absence), which ultimately depend on perceptual data. On the other hand there is dharma, which cannot be known through sense-perception and for which, therefore, the Veda is the only instrument of knowledge. Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā authors also claim that all cognitions, qua cognitions, are in themselves valid, unless and until a subsequent cognition invalidates them (the theory is called svataḥ prāmāṇya."

## nayyaayika-s
- "Authors" are reliable. If some "dRShTArtha" claims (eg. statements made in jyotiH shAstra regarding grahaNa or some Ayurvedic mantra) by the same sage are verifiable, so are other "adRShTArtha" claims \[[IMG](../../../../images/snippets/veda-authority-nyAya.png), [KKM](http://kamakotimandali.com/advaita/shabda.html), [Jayanta-KK12](http://www2.lit.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kkataoka/Kataoka/FreschiKataoka2012.pdf)\].
  - "Accordingly, the reliable speaker knows the topic and desires to communicate what he knows. He is epistemically and morally competent. This reliable speaker of sacred texts can, according to Jayanta, only be God."
- Consensus of great people. \[[Jayanta-KK12](http://www2.lit.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kkataoka/Kataoka/FreschiKataoka2012.pdf)\]
