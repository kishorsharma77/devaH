title: Non-absoluteness
---


Textual authority is not absolute.

## Implausibility
- The validity of pratyakSha and pratyakSha-like anumAna evidence in cases where they are available. In such cases, texts are not to be taken literally.
- See the "न हि श्रुतिशतमपि" quote by shankara above.
- "अप्रत्यक्षाणि शास्त्राणि विवादस्तेषु केवलम्। प्रत्यक्षं ज्योतिषं शास्त्रं चन्द्रार्कौ यत्र साक्षिणौ।।"
- The texts (esp. veda-s) are about matters that are not easily graspable by pratyakSha. No one can see a "puNya" particle when one does a dhArmika act. Only obliquely can one ascribe the benefits of many observances to the "Lindy effect".
    - परोक्षप्रिया इव हि देवाः प्रत्यक्षद्विषः।। शतपथ०।। 
    - परोक्षविषया वेदाः परोक्षप्रिया इव हि देवाः ऐ.उ.1।14बृ.उ.4।2।2

## Incompleteness
- This is freely admitted
    - Eg. endlessness of the veda-s as seen from the story of bharadhvAja in the taittirIya brAhmaNa and elsewhere \[[here](http://advaita-l.advaita-vedanta.narkive.com/MYrtMSe6/anantaa-vai-vedaah#post3)\]
    -  taittirIya saMhitA (7.3.1.4) states: parimitā vā ṛcaḥ parimitāni sāmāni parimitāni yajūṁṣy athaitasyaivānto nāsti yad brahma
- One reason for the incompleteness is the sheer impossibility of anticipating and correctly weighing in on circumstances far outside one's (the sage's) spatio-temporal context.

## Corruption
- Likelihood of "corruption" (ie later additions, deletions and editing) of the details of nearly all works has been acknowledged (see "Authority contests and pedigree", and the case of veda-s) in many places.

## Allowance for Context
- The acknowledged need to consider the context of their composition and need for later mutation.
- Hindu behavioral (../social/ legal/ personal) system is **not at all static**. More [here](../../social-cultivation/dharma-fluid/).
- The acknowledged need to interpret (an unspecified number of) statements rather than take them literally.

## Moral ought?
- According to some: Hindu traditions do **not have the moral "ought"** -rather they intend the word "should" - a statement of opinion that may require discussion and justification.
- (The distinction is explained [in this article](http://www.hipkapi.com/2011/03/18/ought-vs-should/) by a follower of shrI-bAlagangAdhara.) Summary: (a) " You should not play with fire if you do not want to get burnt." vs (b) "You ought not to torture fellow-human beings (if you want to remain a moral human being)." : Regarding (a): Is the statement valid if I wear a fire-proof suit, or I use a long non-conductive stick, or move a robot to do that using remote control? Of course not.

## Stories as allegories in the shAstra-s
- Hindu holy texts sometimes describe events and phenomena, which may be sometimes taken as (or mistaken as) historical or scientific fact.
- The stories pertaining to the deva-s are explicitly admitted to be "illusory" in the veda itself.
