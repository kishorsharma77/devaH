## Intro
Ethnic shifts provide important context for development of later social organizations.

## Initial peopling
- First came early hominids such as H.heidelbergensis from around 250,000-300,000 years BP.
- [Indian hunter gatherers](../../../../paganology/indian_hunter_gatherer) came next.
- Then the [iranian-farmer-invasion](../../../../paganology/iranian-farmer)
- Then, [Aryan migration/ invasion](../../../../paganology/Aryan/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/)
- Then, [Austro-Asiatic incursion](../../../../paganology/austro-asiatic/orissa-invasion)
- [dravidian-bloom](../../../../paganology/Aryan/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/Arya-invasion)
- Great [Indo Aryan consolidations](../../../../paganology/Aryan/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/Arya-consolidation)

## Islamic invasions
- Finally, during the Islamic invasions, we get some Turkik input.
- These seem to have left comparatively little genetic footprints even among muslims. Partly because they are genetically very similar to the earlier Aryan influx - albeit more admixed with Turkik markers. "Detectable ancestry - probably less than 10%, closer to 1%." - RK
