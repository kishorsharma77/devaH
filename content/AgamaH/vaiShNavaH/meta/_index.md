## अतिमार्गाः
### सहजीयाः
- The Vaishnava-Sahajiya sought religious experience through the five senses which included human coupling and sexual love. Sahaja (Sanskrit: “easy” or “natural”) as a system of worship was prevalent in the Tantric traditions common to both Hinduism and Buddhism in Bengal as early as the 8th–9th centuries. The tradition used the romance between Krishna and Radha as a metaphor for union with God, and sought to experience that union through its physical reenactment. It teaches that the ideal way to understand the union of humanity is to transcend the profane aspects of sexual intercourse and experience it as a divine act. 
- The Vaisnava-Sahajiyas operated in secrecy because their sexual tantric practices were viewed with marked disdain by other religious communities. In their literature they adopted an enigmatic style employing substitutions and correspondences that has come to be known as twilight language (Sanskrit: saṃdhyā-bhāṣā).
- The cult was centered in Bengal. It began in the 16th century, although predecessors existed as early as the 8th century in the same city. The founder is generally thought to be Baru Chandidas, who lived in the 14th century. 

### विरोधः
- Caitanya Mahaprabhu has opposed the Sahajiya practice in Vaishnavism on the grounds that a soul cannot be promoted to the status of Radha or her expansions.


## References to veda-nindaka-s
- The resultant pollution due to proximity of marUnmatta-s to the members Pāñcarātra community was dealt with expiations detailed in the Śri Praśnasaṃhitā. (The curious mentioning of the Turuṣkas who live in the villages among the Hindu population in the Śri Praśnasaṃhitā points to the fact that it could've been composed at a date later than 1000 CE or that this work was either continuously revised or a derivative of an older text.)
- Sanatkumārasaṃhitā exclaims to deny those persons who reject the Vedas & revile gods & Brahmins to witness their ceremonies. 
- Paramasaṃhitā recommends one to "keep in the company of devotees of Viṣṇu and avoid dispusting with them". (Medieval Religious Literature in Sanskrit, Jan Gonda)
