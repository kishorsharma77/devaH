## References to veda-nindaka-s
- The resultant pollution due to proximity of marUnmatta-s to the members Pāñcarātra community was dealt with expiations detailed in the Śri Praśnasaṃhitā. (The curious mentioning of the Turuṣkas who live in the villages among the Hindu population in the Śri Praśnasaṃhitā points to the fact that it could've been composed at a date later than 1000 CE or that this work was either continuously revised or a derivative of an older text.)
- Sanatkumārasaṃhitā exclaims to deny those persons who reject the Vedas & revile gods & Brahmins to witness their ceremonies. 
- Paramasaṃhitā recommends one to "keep in the company of devotees of Viṣṇu and avoid dispusting with them". (Medieval Religious Literature in Sanskrit, Jan Gonda)
