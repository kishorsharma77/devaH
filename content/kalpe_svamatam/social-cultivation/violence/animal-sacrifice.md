## Vedic Animal sacrifices  
- pashuyAga-s
  - kapinjala-adhikaraNa of mImAmsa-shAstra is a classic illustration (where the question of how many kapinjala birds are to be sacrificed is considered).
  - Certain compulsory पशुयाग-s (usually goat sacrifices) are required of agnihotri-s Eg: निरूढपशुबन्धः. \[Note: Optional cow and horse sacrifice exist, but are barred by the dharma-shAstra-s in the kali-yuga.\] Recent examples - [DH](http://www.deccanherald.com/content/544227/brahmins-hold-yaga-sacrifice-goats.html)16.
  - gavAlambha / cow sacrifice is also referred to in the manu-smRti, and others (eg: as part of madhuparka). Reference sample below.
  - Honoring a guest:
      - "Madhuparka is the practice of offering honey to honour a distinguished guest. According to Yājñavalkyasmṛti 1.110, six kinds of people are offered madhuparka – a priest (ṛtvik), a teacher (ācārya), bridegroom, king, graduate (snātaka), and someone dear to the host. The Baudhāyana Gṛhyasūtra 1.2.65 adds ‘guest’ (atithi) to this list. As part of madhuparka, honey, curds, ghee, water, and grains were offered while meat was optional (See Āśvalāyāna Gṛhyasūtra 1.22.5-26 for more details)."
- Substitutions are endorsed in specific cases
    - "in the varuNapraghAsa, piSTarUpakas of sheep and ram are offered to the marut devas (the praghAsas)".


## Non-vedic animal sacrifice
- Some animal and human sacrifice is not prescribed in the veda-s, but practiced nonetheless by some hindu-s (and rejected by others).
- For durga and profit
    - Gadhimai festival in nepal ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadhimai_festival)).


## Benefits and apologetics
### Emotional benefits
- The emotional benefits of animal sacrifice are many.
- At the end of an elaborate animal sacrifice, the many participants experience a great feeling of peace, at the cosmic order having been restored. \[[DrdakFB15](https://www.facebook.com/maureen.drdak/posts/10153588415369088)\]
- They get to ingest the rare serving of nutritious animal meat. Rest of the time, the diet used to be mostly ovo-lacto-vegetarian. (This is true even in the Mediterranean region, where the word "carnival" implied the consumption of carne/ flesh.)
- The special emotional benefits of such animal sacrifices probably involve maintaining the virility and a certain ruthlessness required of the guardians of our society.

### Other justification
- True to the word "carnival", many hindu families traditionally eat meat only after festivals. Hence, per capita meat consumption is very low compared to, say, USA ([fusa](http://farmusa.org/statistics11.html), [img](http://i.imgur.com/k6KT3cy.jpg)).
- "The sacrifice of animals in Yajnas, etc. is not considered an injury because the animals derive great benefit out of it. The ritual helps them to attain heaven or get higher birth in the future (Manu Smriti 5.40, 41). ... Even if one were to reject these spiritual benefits as metaphors and superstitions, even then it is easy to see that conducting Yajnas are not contradictory to practicing Ahimsa. Ahimsa is an ideal, but except for renunciates, no person even nears ninety percent adherence to it." \[[NG15](http://www.newsgram.com/beef-controversy-yajna-madhuparka-and-the-use-of-beef/)\]

## Opposition
- Story of uparichara vasu falling from heaven for siding with the deities on animal sacrifice \[[Mbh 12.37](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12c037.htm), [Mbh 14.91](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m14/m14091.htm)\].
- "Although animal sacrifices were prevalent in the Vedic period, there were already some attempts to reduce this. They came up with the idea that instead of killing an animal, one could offer heartfelt praise to the gods or a fuel-stick or cooked food (see RVS 8.19.5 and 8.24.20 for example). In later times, they even developed an ingenious theory that a person who eats meat will—in his next birth—become the meat eaten by that animal (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.6.1.3)." \[[SG15](http://indiafacts.org/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/)\]

## References to animal sacrifice
- References to cow sacrifices in veda-s
    - "In the Rigveda Saṃhitā, we see that our ancients cooked the flesh of oxen and offered it to the gods, especially Indra (see RVS 10.86.14 or 10.27.2, for example). Horses, bulls, oxen, barren cows, and rams were sacrificed for Agni (RVS 10.91.14). Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.1.2.21 says that sage Yājñavalkya would eat the meat of cows and oxen, provided it was tender. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.18 says that if a couple wants to beget a son who will grow up to be a great scholar, they have to eat rice cooked with beef, along with ghee. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.7.1.3 goes on to say that meat is the best kind of food!" ... In RVS 8.43.11, Agni is hailed as one whose food is the ox and the barren cow. Often in the Rigveda Saṃhitā (see 1.164.27, 1.164.40, 4.1.6, and 5.83.8, for example), the cow is called aghnyā, ‘one who doesn’t deserve to be killed.’ Therefore, it seems that only barren cows were killed. How else do we account for the lavish praise showered on cows (RVS 6.23.1-8 and 8.101.15-16)? One verse (RVS 8.101.16), which hails the cow as devī, ‘goddess.’" [SG15](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/).

    - "Brahma Sūtra (3.1.25) says that the scriptures don’t have a problem with killing animals for a specified ritual. Even the Manusmṛti, a text that is rather partial to vegetarianism, says that meat-eating is fine under specific circumstances like during a calamity or as part of a ritual (MS 5.27, 5.32)."[SG15](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/).
- References in classical poetry
    - "In the Mahābhārata (Droṇa Parva / Book 3, Chapter 199), sage Mārkāṇḍeya tells Yudhiṣṭhira the story of a hunter and a priest. When the priest accuses the hunter of violence, the latter narrates the story of King Rantideva: “In Rantideva’s kitchen, two thousand animals were killed every day as were two thousand cows. Rantideva became famous because he fed meat to all his people."[SG15](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/).
    - " Kālidāsa (5th century CE) says in Meghadūta 1.45 that River Charmanvati (modern-day Chambal) arose from the glory of King Rantideva who sacrificed thousands of cows. Mallinātha (13th century CE) says in his commentary on the Meghadūta that Charmanvati originated with the constant washing of cow hide and the flowing of the blood of cows."[SG15](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/).
