## Legal disabilities 
-   Higher punishment for certain offences.
    -   For example: Adultry with a dvija woman, slander against a dvija.
    -   Attenuation: In several cases, a person of a higher varṇa was subject to greater prāyaścitta and daṇḍa. For example, Manu and Gautama require that a brāhmaṇa, a kṣatriya and a vaishya would respectively be fined eight, four and two times more respectively than a śūdra. Kātyāyana and Vyāsa make this principle a general rule for all offences.
-   A śūdra could not be a judge in high courts (if he was not a king, to be sure).
-   Lower punishments were prescribed for killing a śūdra.


## Limitations on social intercourse with dvija-s
-   brāhmaṇa-s could not accept alms from them or eat their cooked food in common circumstances, or even be touched by him.
    -   All this was earlier allowed in some cases, but was later barred as something to be avoided in the kali age (kali-varjya).
-   Marital relationship (especially between a shūdra male and a dvija female) was discouraged.
