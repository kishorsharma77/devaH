title = "Connection"
+++

- Gods are conscious entities with whom we can connect (given mutual desire and effort). 
- Connecting with them can elevate us in myriad ways (See [benefits](benefits) page).
- The Gods gain NOTHING from connecting to us, or receiving our adoration. They don't "feed" on our adulation. They are perfectly satisfied and complete - even if no human exists. 
- We can be disconnected from the Gods due to spread of mental diseases (atheisms including so-called monotheisms). In such a case one has to work hard for generations to reestablish solid connection (like 20th century western pagan revivalists).

## Deva-bhakta relationship
We emphasize that to a practicing hindu, they are not remotely abstract entities like Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Juno are to (sadly) Christianized Italians; rather they are alive and immediate in the artistic experience that is the hindu way of thought. One propitiates them regularly with various rituals (In fact, I am more observant than most) as if they were wilful entities, and questions about their imaginary nature never enter my mind when involved with hindu rituals. It is a primeval way of looking at nature and life. IshAna still lives in our rage, Indra in our stength, prithivI/ Earth in our body, herbs in our hair, sarasvatI on the tip of my tongue, agni in my speech and so on. (A lament on the fools that chose to leave this for the monotony and paleness of Abrahamisms [is here](http://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/the-fools-that-converted/).)
