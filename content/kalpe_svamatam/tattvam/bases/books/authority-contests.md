title: Pedigree and corruption
---

## Intro
Scholars have been selective about deciding whether any book's statement can be taken as authoritative.
- Patanjali (in पस्पशाह्निकम् , महाभाष्यम् ) cautions "क्व पुनरिदं  पठितम् ?  भ्राजा नाम श्लोकाः । किंच भोः श्लोका अपि प्रमाणम् ?  किंचातः ? यदि प्रमाणम् , अयमपि प्रमाणम् भवितुम् अर्हति ..... प्रमत्तगीत एष तत्रभवतः । यस्तु अप्रमत्तगीतः तत्प्रमाणम् ।"


## Bases of authority
- Historical claims about authorship is used by some traditions, in order to nominally claim some form of divine origin and higher authority in case of disputes. This is amore general phenomenon, called pseudepigrapha.
  - Eg. Jīva Gosvāmin argues in his Tattvasandarbha that Vyāsa’s insight or samādhi is the source of the Bhāgavata’s teachings, and that his authorship – at a particular time and location in history – is what gives the śāstra its authority over all other Purāṇic, Upaniṣadic and Vedic śāstras (Dāsa 1995). \[Jonathan B. Edelmann\]
  - This was, rather, an excellent way to neutralize "argument from authority" - since every view and its opposite ended up claiming divine origins.
  - Compare with [Pseudo-Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-Aristotle) among the greeks.
- Some works base their authoritativeness on being extracted from or based on (extinct) veda shaakhaa-s.
    - pAncharAtrika-s claim pedegree from ekAyana-veda \[[LT_U](https://archive.org/stream/LakshmiTantra/Lakshmi%20Tantra%201975%20VKrishnamacharya#page/n10/mode/1up)\].

## Challenges to authority claims
### Interpolation
- A position adopted by the likes of madhvAcArya is that many works (especially itihAsa-s and purANa-s) contains interpolations, deletions and corruptions. \[[MTN](http://mahabharata-resources.org/mbtntrans/chapter_2_gururajahrao.pdf)  2.3\]
- advaitins consider the Padma Purana verse equating Mayavada and crypto-Buddhism as an interpolation.
- vedAntadeshika pointed out that some use fabricated texts, ascribing them to vyAsa.
- bhaviShyapurANa
    - "Many parts of Bhavishya purana are original. Some chapter were added in time of Akbar to show him reincarnation of Prithviraj Chauhan. 2 chapters were added by either William Jones or Eric Pargiter to show that British are descendants of Hanuman who were blessed by Bhagvan Ram to rule India. William Jones also removed some key verses of puranas."

### Contests based on language
- kumarIla-bhaTTa notes in a lengthy pUrvapakSa claim (via the voice of his "opponent") that the authors of the kalpa texts made many grammatical errors!

### Examples
- Various primary texts insult or controvert certain other texts (and vice-versa).
- For examples of bickering between brAhmaNas of various shAkhA-s, see [veda](../vedas/) page.
- Certain purANa-s insult certain Agama-s.
    - See kUrma-purANa quote below.
- Within vaiShNava-Agama-s
    - pAncharAtra and vaikhAnasa texts appear to challenge each other.

### Later harmonization
- By the nahi-nindA nyAya, scholars ([LT_U](https://archive.org/stream/LakshmiTantra/Lakshmi%20Tantra%201975%20VKrishnamacharya#page/n12/mode/1up)) have often understood these contesting statements as merely advertising their own exaltedness - given the mutual complementarity (besides competitiveness) of the relationship between such texts and traditions.
- Consider the analogous role of myths showing conflicts among the deva-s.
- Even the mutual bickering among brAhmaNa-s of veda shAkhA-s was harmonized in this way by the sUtra period.
