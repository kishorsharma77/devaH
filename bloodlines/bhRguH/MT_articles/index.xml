Vedic regard In the Rgveda the gotama-s repeatedly and respectfully mention the bhRgu-s as the founders of the fire rite, which is consonant with their position at the head of the shrauta gotra-pravara lists.
For example:
 dadhuSh TvA bhRgavo mAnuSheShvA rayiM na chAruM suhavaM janebhyaH |
hotAram agne atithiM vareNyaM mitraM na shevaM divyAya janmane ||RV 1.58.6
 Here nodhA gautama declares that the bhRgu-s first established the ritual fire in the midst of men.</description>

The imprint of the bhRgu-s is not just all over the literature of bhAratavarSha but also dotting the very expanses of the land of the bhArata-s. While being a bhRgu, I may be biased to see this imprint more than others, the fact has been observed by many others. The following is a purely parochial view of history seen through the lens of my ancestry, yet I believe there are elements of real significance for the history of the Hindu nation.</description>

From the accounts of vedic tradition the bhRgu-s were the foremost of the RShi-s. It appears that they were the founders of the fire ritual which is at the heart of the vedic religion. They are not authors of many mantra-s of the Rg veda, though their surrogate clan, the shaunahotra-s, have a maNDala to themselves (RV2). Nevertheless, bhRgu or the bhRgu-s are mentioned 27 times by name in the RV.</description>
