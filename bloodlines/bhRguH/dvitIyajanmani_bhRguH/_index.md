- "bhR^igu created rakSha-s to attack rudra's party on behalf of dakSha; shukra stole kubera's wealth and fought a battle with rudra; bhR^igu's wife paulomI hid the asura-s from the deva-s and was beheaded by viShNu."

- असौ ब्रह्मविष्णुमहेश्वरान् अपि धर्षयाञ्चकार। तस्यैव पादस्य चिह्नं विष्णोरुरसि **श्रीवत्स** इति।
- कृतवीर्यस्य हैहयस्य राज्ञो गुरुर् भृगुः। तद्दानात् समृद्धा भार्गवाः। कार्तवीर्या ईर्षया ऽपहृतवन्तस् तद्धनम्, तयोर् वैरं जातम्।
- वीतहव्यं राजानं चकार ब्राह्मणम्।
- महान्तं तत्त्वविचारं चकार।

> "The references in the atharva veda and the older cycles of the bhArgava myth in the mahabhArata, suggest that the core of these events concerned a historical struggle between the bhR^igus and the haihaya rulers of mAhiShmati. However, the later pauraNic redactions of the myth, and late reinsertion in the mahAbhArata seem to have given it the color of a general struggle between the kShatriyas and brahmins+rest of castes. I believe that this generalization was actually inspired again by a similar constellation of much later historical events that inspired the manu smR^iti’s reaction to the shudra threat. These events were most probably the oppressive rule of the nanda-s, colored to certain degree by the atrocities of the foreign rulers (described as shudras by the manu smR^iti) around the same time. The victory of the brAhmaNa ruler puShyamitra shu~Nga, probably inspired a mythological reworking, in which his clan’s glorious victories were compared to the historical struggle of parashurAma, and that tale romanticized to its extant mythological form. It is not a matter of coincidence that the politically pre-eminant brahmin clan, the bhArgavas were involved, both in the generalization of their family epic (the parashurAma epic) and the redaction of the manu smR^iti into its extant form." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/09/01/inter-caste-strife/)\]
