## पिता
> The Matsya Purana says that Bhrigu married Paulomi to whom were born the 12 Yajnika Devas and two Vipras. The two Vipras were Chyavana and Apnuvana. Apnuvana was the father of Aurva from whom was born Jamadagni. This Purana makes Chyavana and Apnavana brothers which seems unlikely.


## प्रजाः
> Ruchi, the daughter of Nahusha married Apravana and they got a son named Aurva. Rchaka was born through Aurva and Jamadagni was born from Rchaka. - ब्रह्माण्डपुराणे.

"Vatsa, after whom our Gotra is named, was born from Apnavana. Vatsa had a son named Etasha, who married Aurushi to beget the fierce Aurva." इति केचित्।
