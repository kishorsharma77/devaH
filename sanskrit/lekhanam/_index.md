## Whitespace conventions
I _sometimes_ like to follow the convention shown here: "व्याख्यातुं कुशलाः केचिद् ग्रन्थान् धारयितुम् परे॥". Whatever helps the reader.

### Objection to uniformity
An objection I've come across multiple times is as follows: "As I had indicated to you earlier, the break up of words is fine for your conversational exchanges, news reoprting, indology word analysis, personal study, and to teach students, but not for the original texts. They should not be disturbed."

To this, my response is to note as follows: If you want to "keep it original" - you should remove EVERY bit of whitespace (and even very many avagrahas) - that was how all indian scripts were written 200 years ago as may be verified from palm leaf manuscripts. There is no shAstra requiring me to follow some arbitrary, modern and inconsistent rule for breaking up words. As such my personal convenience trumps such shaky conventions.
