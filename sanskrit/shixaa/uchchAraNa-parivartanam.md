- "The orthodox Indian tradition has greatly respected the relationship of a teacher and his disciple and has continued to believe that nothing ever changed in this oral transmission. It is believed that the oral text has been handed down from one generation to the next without any changes. However, we must view a preliterate oral tradition with a fresh linguistic and analytical approach. We must distinguish a “pseudo-connection” from a “real connection” between two successive synchronic states of a preliterate oral text."

## लल्लावाक्यानाम् उदाहरणम्
- "Grierson (1929) has given a fascinating account of how the Kashmiri text of Lalla-vAkyAni, originally composed in the latter half of the fourteenth century, has been preserved orally to the present day without ever having been written down. Grierson (1929:74) points out that “save for a few forms that have remained unchanged...her verses are in what is practically modern Kashmiri.” However, the text of the Mahanayaprakasha was composed in the fifteenth century and was written down at the time it was composed, and hence its language is preserved without any further change. "
- "Grierson describes the 'unconscious' change taking place in a precodification oral tradition: “Each hymn [of Lalla-vAkyAni] was handed down from teacher to pupil through five centuries, care being taken to preserve the text unchanged. But during all this time the language was insensibly changing, and, as there was no written record of the originals in the form in which they were first uttered, the language of the hymns insensibly changed at the same time. The reciters, it is hardly necessary to point out, were unaware of the change of language that was going on. In each generation that was very slight, and was not noticeable, but the total of the changes at the end of five centuries was very great indeed....It was so gradual that no one was ever aware that any change was talcing place at all” (1929:75). Grierson clearly perceived that the same must have happened in the case of the Vedic texts before they were codified by the redactors."

## Loanword approximation
- Western European pronunciation of T, D is NOT retroflex (tongue curl).
  - "The British had to use hundreds of local Indian words in English. However, they did not pick up the retroflex sounds, but rather approximated them to other English sounds. Thus, the Marathi place name पुणॆ became “Poona” and खड्कि came to be called “Kirkee.*”"
  - "When native speakers of Indian languages heard English with their “Indian ears,” English alveolars were naturally felt to be closer to Indian retroflexes and were approximated to Indian retroflexes. For example, English ‘table’ becomes tebal in Marathi."
