Welcome, if you are an Arya! I am deeply interested and invested in Hindu conservativism, via the practice of Sanskrit, mantra-s, tantra-s, kalpa-s and kAvya-s.

## Tech details
### Building this site
- This site is built using the jekyll static website generator, with the sanskrit-documentation theme; and hosted on github.
- Local build time as of 20181129 - 93 sec.
- To avoid github pages build time-out errors, I could be doing the following, but not doing it currently:
  - build the website locally into the docs folder, including a .nojekyll file.
  - push the docs folder
  - ask github to serve the docs folder.
