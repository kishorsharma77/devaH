## परिचयः
### मानसतरङ्गिणीकारः
In the Vr̥ṣākapi hymn, correctly interpreted by Tilak as a precessional myth, Vr̥ṣākapi (the virile ape) makes and illicit advance towards indrANi. For which Indrāṇī punishes him by making a dog (Canis Major) bite him. These analogies suggest that the illicit sexual advance is a motif in the precessional which probably stands as a metaphor for the break in the old order or the longing for a new relationship, previously forbidden.

### तिलकबालगङ्गाधरः
- Source: Orion by BG Tilak  
- Epoch: 4500 BCE. Vernal equinox was at आग्रहायणी = मृगशीर्षम्. Sacrificial period = devayAna = uttarAyaNa was defined as vernal equinox to autumnal equinox; corresponding also to devanaxatra-s.

Vr̥ṣākapi is a Mr̥ga+++(=Orion)+++, and sacrifices are stopped where he revels +++(autumnal to vernal equinox, or Orion visible in night sky)+++. He is, however, a favourite of Indra, and consequently the latter, instead of punishing, follows him. Indrāṇī, who has herself been offended by the Kapi, now reproaches Indra for his over fondness for the animal and threatens to punish the beast by cutting off his head and letting loose a dog+++(=Canis Major)+++ at his ear. Indra intercedes and Indrāṇī assures him that the punishment has not been inflicted on his favorite beast, but on someone else. Vr̥ṣākapi is now going down to his house and Indra, in bidding farewell to his friend, asks him to come up again to his (Indra's) house, so that the sacrifices may be recommenced ; and, strange to say, that when Vriṣākapi +++(as sun in Orion)+++ returns, in his upward march to the house of Indra, the impertinent Mr̥ga is no longer to be seen +++(in the night sky)+++! Vr̥ṣākapi, Indra and Indrāṇī thus finally meet in the same house, without the offensive beast, and the hymn therefore concludes with a benedictory verse +++(to his child bearing wife)+++.

## देवतास्व् अभिप्रायाः
- स्रोतः - Orion by BG Tilak.
- As there is only one hymn in the r̥gveda which gives the story, it is not so easy, as in the case of the r̥bhus, to determine the nature of the deity, and hence various conjectures have been made by scholars as to its origin, character and meaning. The deities appear both in the masculine and in the feminine form, Vr̥ṣākapi and Vr̥shakapayī.
- In the Br̥had-devatā Vr̥ṣākapi is said to represent the setting sun, and Vr̥shakapayī the gloaming.
- Yāska (12. 27) would derive the word so as to mean the sun who shakes (the world) with his rays, and his commentator observes that the god showers mist or dew and shakes the animate world.
- Amara\* considers that Vr̥ṣākapi means either Vishṇu or Shiva, and Vr̥shakapayī either Lakshmi or Gaurī. +++(\* Amara iii. 3. 130 and 156. हरो विष्णुर् वृषाकपिः and वृषाकपायी श्रीगौर्योः।)+++
- had Yāska and Sāyaṇa known that there is a constellation called dog in the heavens by the side of Mr̥gaśiras, I feel certain that they would not have hesitated to recognize in Vr̥ṣākapi, the sun as represented by the constellation of Orion.
- Prof. Max Müller, in one place, +++(Lectures on the Science of Language Vol. II., p. 539, )+++ observes that "it is difficult, on seeing the game of Vr̥ṣākapi, not to think of Erikapaeos, an Orphic name of Protogonos and synonymous with Phanes, Helios, Priapos, Dionysos," but, says he, "the original conception of Vr̥ṣākapi (Vr̥shan, bull, irrigator; Kapi, ape, tremulous) is not much clearer than that of Erikapireos."
