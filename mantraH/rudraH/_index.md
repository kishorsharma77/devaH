## रुद्रः
- पशुपतिः। मरुत्पतिः। रोगदो रोगहा च।
- यज्ञभागाभिमानी - तददाने तु कुप्यति।
- पश्चाद् उमापतिः, गनेशकार्त्तिकेययोः पिता।
- आर्द्रया सम्बद्धः! नक्षत्रसूक्तमीक्षताम्। 
    - तच्छिरस आकाशगङ्गा +उत्पतति। तत्पार्श्वे शरवणम्, यत्र पुत्रः कार्त्तिकेयो जजान।
    - खे स मृगशीर्षधारिणं प्रजापतिम् इन्वकेषुना हन्ति।

### दिवो ऽसुरः
- tvam agne rudro asuro maho divaḥ (RV 2.1.6) 
- yathā rudrasya sūnavo divo vaśanty asurasya vedhasaḥ | (RV 8.20.17)
- indrota tubhyaṃ tad dive tad rudrāya svayaśase | (RV 1.129.3)

### यमलत्वं क्वचित्
- "One of the notable aspects differentiating the early Atharvaṇ tradition from the RV tradition with regard to Rudra is the use of the twin appellation Bhavā-Śarvā for the deity in the former. These names of Rudra also persist in the ādhvaryava tradition preserved in the Yajurveda-s but the twinning is less prominent relative the AV tradition. Notably, in the celebrated Mṛgāreṣṭi ritual the AV tradition features a sūkta to the twin Bhavā-Śarvā whereas in its place the KYV tradition has ṛk-s to the Aśvin-s. This points to two parallel streams within the early Vedic tradition which featured Rudra in singular form (apart from the plurality of the Rudra-class) as seen in the RV or in twin form of Bhavā-Śarvā as seen in the AV. This suggests that the Rudra-class had an ancient intrinsic twin nature shared with the Aśvin-s which lingers in the Bhavā-Śarvā dyad. Notably, even in Greek tradition the deity of the Rudra-class, Apollo is born with twin (albeit female), Artemis. While the RV Aśvin-s are identical twins in character, sometimes, in the IE world one sees some differentiation of the the twins with one of them associated with healing and animal-husbandry and the other with warfare. For example, among the Yavana-s, one of the pair, Castor is a horse-trainer while the other one Polydeuces is a boxer. A similar differentiation is perhaps reflected in the twin Rudra-s, with the name Bhava indicating welfare and health, and the and Śarva meaning and archer and indicating the warrior nature of the second twin. Thus, it is likely that Bhava and Śarva were part of the parallel Vedic tradition where they played the role of the Aśvin-s as twin Rudra-s."

- "A later reflex of this twinning in the Rudra-class appears to have emerged via developments in the form of the Kaumāra tradition emerging in the Indo-Iranian borderlands. There we see the dual form of the god Kumāra as Skanda-Viśākha. This dyad is earliest attested in the Atharvavedīya-Skanda-yāga from the AV-pariśiṣṭha-s and has a prolonged presence in the Hindu tradition. The grammarian Patañjali mentions metal images of Rudra along with the Skanda-Viśākha dyad in the Mauryan age (~322-185 BCE)."

### सम्बद्धदेवाः
- मरुतः।
- अश्विनाव् अपि।

### लिङ्गम्
- linga can mean both a symbol and a phallus.
- Though to modern devotees, the linga tends to be a symbol of shiva (with no sexual connotations), it had associations with the erect human phallus, representing the yogic Urdhvaretas power and paradoxical fertility of shiva.
    - Eg. the ancient linga at [guDimallam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudimallam). There are also several images of shiva with an erect phallus.
    - किरातपतेर् ऊर्ध्वरेतस्त्वं यो न जानाति स खलु प्रायेण नावगच्छति लिङ्गस्य स्वारस्यमित्य् अनुमामि। 
- "What is embarrassing about the phallic significance of the Śivaliṅga? People keep repeating verses praising the head & feet of the deva but get disgusted at a symbol that connotes what? The eternal fatherhood & motherhood of Śiva & his inseparable Śakti. I don’t care if getting defensive about the phallic significance is the politically “right” stance to take as per the prude-tva consensus. I am & will be a Śaiva till my last breath & will never be apologetic for the phallic significance of the Śivaliṅga. ... I don’t care for such immature folks. I care for the opinion of Śrī-Upamanyu-Ṛṣi who states in Mahābhārata that Śiva-Devī are the only deities whose signs/insignia are found on the very persons of all humans & even beasts."

## अश्विनौ
- "Further, this sūkta mentions our ancient ancestor Cyavāna as the one who had measured out the vedi for the for the Aśvin-s. Cyavāna is mentioned in tradition as the one who instituted the rite where soma is offered to the Aśvin-s. Indeed, in the above ṛk it appears that Kakṣīvān seeks Indra permission for the same as there are indications from later narratives that Indra was not entirely on board with that."

## रुद्रसम्बन्धः
- "The ancient name of the Aśvin-s is Divo Napatā. The twin sons of Dyaus. This is an equivalent of the name of their Greek cognates the Dioskouroi (the national deities of the Spartans), meaning the youths of Zeus (the cognate of Dyaus; Skt Divaḥ Kumārau) or their Lithuanian cognates Dievo Suneliai (Sons of Dieva = Dyaus)." [MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/the-asvin-s-and-rudra/)
    - दिवः पतिस् तु रुद्रो भाति बहुत्र (" indrota tubhyaṃ tad dive tad rudrāya svayaśase | (RV 1.129.3)")। तेनेतौ रुद्राव् इत्यप्युक्तम् - "uta tyā me raudrāv"। "Their “Raudra nature” is clearly brought out in the ṛk RV 10.93.7: uta no rudrā cin mṛḻatām aśvinā : Also, though being Rudra-s, may the Aśvin-s be merciful. ... Consistent with this, they share their medical prowess with Rudra (as physicians of the gods) and even more tellingly also their knowledge of poisons with Rudra."
    - भवशर्वाभ्यां सह सम्बन्धस्योह उपर्युक्तो रुद्रविभागे।
- " it is plausible that the term Rudravartanī and the association of the Aśvin-s with Rudra have an astronomical significance. In the classic nakṣatra system that developed by the time of the AV and the YV the Aśvin-s are associated with the constellation of Aśvayujau which corresponds to part of Aries. However, the obvious constellation that resembles the divine twins is Gemini, which was recognized as the Dioscuri in the Greek tradition. ... a potential connection is seen in RV 10.39.11 where the Aśvin-s are called Rudravartanī and explicitly linked Aditi ... O Aśvins, you who are easy to invoke, follow the track of Rudra. "

## कुमारः
- शिवात्मजः पुराणेषु। 
- खय् आकाशगङ्गायाः पार्श्वे शरवणे रुद्रस्य रेतसो जातः, अग्निना कृत्तिकाभिश्च वर्धितः। 
  - ततो हि कार्तिकमासे स्कन्द-षष्ट्य्-आचरणम्। अग्निसम्बन्धाद् अस्य नक्षत्रस्य सायन-मासोपि स्यात् (विषुवपरिसरे)। तारामण्डलसम्बन्धात् तु यथादृष्टम् अपि वा।
- तस्मात् स्कन्दविशाखौ जातौ। विशाखा नक्षत्रं खचक्रे कृत्तिकाया विपरीतदिशि हि वर्तते। 

## गणपतिः
- गणेशचतुर्थ्यां लोक आचर्यमाणायां गणपतिर् आविर्बभूव दृढं सवितुः स्थाने, तत्रापि गायत्रीश्येनस्योपरि! विचित्रं दृश्यम्। पश्चाद् विचार्य - समञ्जसं हि तद् इत्यभात्। कुतः - अनुज्ञादाताराव् उभाव् अपि, सर्वकर्मस्व् आदौ कीर्तितौ। किञ्च व्यावृत्तिर् एषा - विनायको भयानको विघ्नोत्पादने ऽपि दक्षः, न केवलविघ्नोपशमने।
