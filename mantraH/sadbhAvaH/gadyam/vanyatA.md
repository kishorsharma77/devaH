Wild, but not savage.

## GuruAnaerobic-ब्राह्मणम्
"The closest to a wild environment is being in a Street Gang, with its periods of inaction and intense action, adrenaline, and psychological danger. This is because young people are still wild. Yet people say that is wrong. Society doesn't like wildness. It's scared by it. It will stop you from being wild. It wants you to conform, but as soon as you conform, your life-force and spirit is dead."
