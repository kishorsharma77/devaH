      <description>Etymologically, the goddesses of the waters can be understood as Apsaras-es with Urvaśī, Sahajanyā, Ghṛtācī and Menakā at their head (From Rāṣṭrabhṛt-s). Kavi, the son of Bhṛgu: &amp;ldquo;samudriyā apsaraso manīṣiṇam āsīnā antar abhi somam akṣaran |&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;This identity of the Apsaras-es as the goddesses of the waters is reinforced in the famous ritual of the apsaras-es and the gandharva of the ocean, which we shall perform at a different time.</description>

      <description>अप्सम्बन्धः, प्राचीनता च  The river is textually identified with the aquatic deity of the Indo-Aryans, sarasvatI who is widely worshiped in the R^igveda and persists to this date in the modern Hindu religions as a consort of brahmA. &amp;hellip;
One of the important themes that emerges from the aponaptrIya ritual is the intimate connection between sarasvati and Agni as worshipped as the son of the waters or apAM napAta. This fiery entity hidden with the water is of ancient IE provenance as is evidenced by the word naptha meaning a fiery substance and the same time bearing a relationship to the word naptar or relative, suggesting that it was essentially derived from the ancestral state ApAM napAt.</description>
