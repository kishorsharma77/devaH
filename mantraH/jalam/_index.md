- आपः - सर्वा देवताः। पावक्यः।
  - yā divyā āpaḥ payasā saṃbabhūvuḥ | yā antarikṣa uta pārthivīryāḥ | - "The earthly realm is easily understood: the oceans and rivers and the like. The atmospheric realm too is obvious. the heavenly realm - Milky way. Even the moon is said to be contained in them. "
  - “The idea of divyā āpaḥ is also philosophically satisfying in a current sense. After all where did water on the earth come from? Most likely from the asteroids, the comets, and the objects of the dwarf planet belt. Thus, we may say all the earthly waters are indeed from the divyā āpaḥ.” ([MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/12/30/matters-of-religion-3/))
- अप्सरसः
  - Etymologically, the goddesses of the waters can be understood as Apsaras-es with Urvaśī, Sahajanyā, Ghṛtācī and Menakā at their head (From Rāṣṭrabhṛt-s). Kavi, the son of Bhṛgu: "samudriyā apsaraso manīṣiṇam āsīnā antar abhi somam akṣaran |". "This identity of the Apsaras-es as the goddesses of the waters is reinforced in the famous ritual of the apsaras-es and the gandharva of the ocean, which we shall perform at a different time. There we shall encounter another dangerous class of 80 Apsaras-es who are known as the Uluṅgulukā-s, coming in groups of 31, 4, 10, 10, 25, associated with the asura Uluṅgula."
