      <description>The great Kashmirian author in his text the dashAvatAracharitra which was written in 1066 AD describes the conditions that would prevail on the earth just before the coming of kalki.
“The Turushkas, Pathans, Daradas and dwellers of Shakastan will cause the earth to decay as do the leper his open oozing sores. Every direction overrun by the dreadful mlechChas, the earth will resound with the clash of swords drawn in combat and her soil will be soaked with blood.</description>

      <description>An important rite for cleaning oneself of the ritual ills is the performance of the pApapuruSha dhyAnaM, which is closely linked to the sAMkhya thought that pervades the tantra. The mental vidhi is spelt out in the bhutashuddhi tantra. Parallel purificatory details are also provided by ishAnashiva’s manual on the siddhAnta tantra stream. First one performs the bhuta sR^ishTi krama thus:
pR^ithivI bIja: R^iShi=brahmA, Chandas=gAyatrI, devatA= pR^ithivI. One meditates on the feet up to the knees.</description>

      <description>Weighed down by the arrows showered by our foes, we call upon son of the ranger of kailAsha. He who bears the bow in battle and showers arrows on the dAnava horde. He who is called ugratama and bhImatama, who rushes to battle with the the axe and spear, we worship him in the midst of the six-fold maNDala. One who is dallying with sumukhi and biDAlAkShI, we bow to him.</description>

The below material arose as a collaborative venture in course of extended discussions with KR.

The winter solstice/year beginning in the last part of shraviShTha (1300 BCE)
The three great categories of gods in the veda and beyond Though absent in the extant Iranian texts, the oldest Indo-Aryan texts recognize the presence of three major categories of deva-s — the vasu-s, rudra-s and Aditya-s. This triad is mentioned on a number of occasions in the R^igveda.</description>

      <description>Having bowed to the one sleeping atop the coils of the snake of time we salute the greatest of his weapons.
oM urugAyAya hum phaT //
That supreme emanation of the shakti of nArAyaNa manifested with a predominance of her tejas, is as bright as many millions of suns, moons and fires in profusion. It pervades the tryambaka vidya of the 7th maNDala of the R^igveda. It is described as the supreme udyama, foremost prANa and all weapons and shaktis of the hordes of viShNu and vishvaksena arise from it.</description>

      <description>The bauddhas have internalized the last incarnation of viShNu, the all-destroying kalki or pramati who is said to annihilate the mlecchas and dasyus and restore the world to the Aryas. The kAlachakra tantra of the unclean upachInAchAra stream gives a highly remarkable account of the end of the yuga. It’s parallels to the mainstream Hindu version are unmistakable and appears to have been clearly derived from it [It is even possible that there was a now lost Hindu version which might have been a closer precursor of the version in the kAlachakra tantra].</description>

      <description>The birth anniversary of the dark hero of the yadus dawned. We decided to
recall his awful deeds in course of his momentous life that overlapped with the tumult taking place in the bhArata realms.
-The yadu was born to vasudeva and devakI, who were imprisoned by kaMsa, devakI’s brother.The tyrant kaMsa had been told that devakI’s 8th son will kill him one day.
-devakI’s eighth son was born on a rohiNI aShtTami, and was spirited away by vasudeva to his cowherd friend nanda’s abode.</description>

      <description>Upon the great snake shesha sleeps the great god viShNu, even as the the kalpa wears out. He stirs only when the waters rise and threaten to sink the world plane. This shesha is time and hence he is called ananta. Thus, when viShNu sleeps on the coils of the great world snake he is experiencing the cyclic passage of time.
Once the great god vAyu and the world snake ananta had a contest of strength.</description>

The mantra rahasyas:
That great mantra encompasses a series of 3 praNavas. The 3 praNavas are the AdhAra that is known as the brahman. This is followed by the 3 tArikAs and the 3 anutArikAs which are two wives of viShNu. They are the supremre states with all things existing in these two shaktis of viShNu.</description>
