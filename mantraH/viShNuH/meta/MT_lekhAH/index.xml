      <description>Clearly there was the classic viShNu-focal system of vedic and earlier IE provenance; then there was the more local evolution in the Indo-Iranian borderlands of the vAsudeva-sAttvata tradition. The earlier harivaMsha was definitely focused on a version of the sAttvata tradition. But there was a parallel strand of vaiShNava tradition predominant among the vaikhAnasa-s &amp;amp; and an early strand of pA~ncharAtra-s that was closer to vaidika focality on viShNu.
The viShNu purANa tries bring the 2 together by giving devakIputra the focus of the &amp;ldquo;earthly&amp;rdquo; expression of the sAttvata religion a central place in the narrative.</description>

      <description>The powers of the great god, who envelops the universe with his 3 strides, dwelling in the ocean of existence sleeping on the snake of time, watched upon by the epitome of the female kind, are put forth as deadly 105 astras.
The head of them is the chakra known as sudarshana:
dhyAtaM sakR^id bhagavAneka koTyaghaugham haratyaram |
sudarshanasya taddivyaM bhargo devasya dhImahi ||
The pravartaka astras of viShNu:
1) brahmAstra 2) daNDa chakra 3) kAlachakra 4) dharmachakra 5) viShNuchakra 6) indra chakra 7) vajrAstra 8) trishUla 9) brahmashiras 10) aiShIkAstra 11) modakI 12) shikharI 13) dharma-pAsha 14) kAla-pAsha 15) varuNa-pAsha 16) Adyo.</description>

      <description>The 3rd stride of viShNu as well as his snake is the enduring Hindus symbol of the axis that precesses with the passage of kAla or time. Right from the R^igveda this axial role of viShNu is at the fore in all conceptions of him. We have alluded to this a few times before, see: snake of viShNu, the Finnish epic, and more obliquely in fall of praHlAda.
The element of the axis and its precession is very much a part of the “core mythology” of viShNu:</description>

      <description>The core pantheon of the pA~ncharAtra texts is the chaturvyuha or the serial emanations of nArAyaNa. The primary manifestation of nArAyaNa is vAsudeva, from whom emerge saMkarShaNa and pradyumna. From pradyumna emerges aniruddha. This pantheon appears to be a unique feature of the yadu tribes that subsequently seems to have spawned the classical pA~ncharAtra. However, the early texts suggest that there was another parallel system that appears to have largely passed out of subsequent vaiShNavism.</description>

      <description>The great Kashmirian author in his text the dashAvatAracharitra which was written in 1066 AD describes the conditions that would prevail on the earth just before the coming of kalki.
“The Turushkas, Pathans, Daradas and dwellers of Shakastan will cause the earth to decay as do the leper his open oozing sores. Every direction overrun by the dreadful mlechChas, the earth will resound with the clash of swords drawn in combat and her soil will be soaked with blood.</description>

      <description>As mentioned earlier in my explorations of the maharaTTa country with shUdra-shreShTha, S and Mis-creant I came across several aniconic padmAvatI stones painted orange with a lead paint. However, in the exploration of Satmala we did see a couple of iconic padmavatI images. One of them was still in worship and another was largely in neglect in a dung-ridden area. This image was strange in having a nAstIka arihant inscribed on her.</description>

The below material arose as a collaborative venture in course of extended discussions with KR.

The winter solstice/year beginning in the last part of shraviShTha (1300 BCE)
The three great categories of gods in the veda and beyond Though absent in the extant Iranian texts, the oldest Indo-Aryan texts recognize the presence of three major categories of deva-s — the vasu-s, rudra-s and Aditya-s. This triad is mentioned on a number of occasions in the R^igveda.</description>

      <description>Having bowed to the one sleeping atop the coils of the snake of time we salute the greatest of his weapons.
oM urugAyAya hum phaT //
That supreme emanation of the shakti of nArAyaNa manifested with a predominance of her tejas, is as bright as many millions of suns, moons and fires in profusion. It pervades the tryambaka vidya of the 7th maNDala of the R^igveda. It is described as the supreme udyama, foremost prANa and all weapons and shaktis of the hordes of viShNu and vishvaksena arise from it.</description>

      <description>The bauddhas have internalized the last incarnation of viShNu, the all-destroying kalki or pramati who is said to annihilate the mlecchas and dasyus and restore the world to the Aryas. The kAlachakra tantra of the unclean upachInAchAra stream gives a highly remarkable account of the end of the yuga. It’s parallels to the mainstream Hindu version are unmistakable and appears to have been clearly derived from it [It is even possible that there was a now lost Hindu version which might have been a closer precursor of the version in the kAlachakra tantra].</description>

      <description>From viShNu emanate several chakra missiles, all of which may follow the deadly sudarshana and discs when used in battle against the dAnavas and rAkShasas. They represent the sum of the deadly destructive fury of viShNu. Likewise, the sampUrNa chakra prayoga rite invokes these weapons to power the countering or attacking mantra missiles.
The following are the chakras:
1) mahArAtridhara chakra: This powered by mahAmAyA and is dark hued and terrifying with a single spoke.</description>

      <description>The birth anniversary of the dark hero of the yadus dawned. We decided to
recall his awful deeds in course of his momentous life that overlapped with the tumult taking place in the bhArata realms.
-The yadu was born to vasudeva and devakI, who were imprisoned by kaMsa, devakI’s brother.The tyrant kaMsa had been told that devakI’s 8th son will kill him one day.
-devakI’s eighth son was born on a rohiNI aShtTami, and was spirited away by vasudeva to his cowherd friend nanda’s abode.</description>

      <description>It is said that there are two emanations of the mantra of the most terrible aShTha-mukha gaNDabheruNDa nR^isimha (AMGN)- a dakShiNa and vAma form. The right-handed form is said to lie in the text termed the bhIma-tantra which is a upa-tantra of the ananta-vijaya saMhitA of the viShNu-yAmala tradition. The left-handed form is said to like in the text termed vAmA-tantra which is also an upa-tantra of the ananta-vijaya saMhitA. Not much is know of the full extant of these texts ( if they survive in an degree at all they are obviously kept a close secret) but fragments relevant to ritual performance have been transmitted to those in the know.</description>

      <description>The hAdi mata votaries from the North also preserved a range of kramas, now largely reduced to auxilliary rites associated as AvarNa invocations of their primary rite of tripurasundarI. This follows the basic pattern seen in the shrIvidyArNava’s procedures. Many of these are strikingly interesting such as the invocation of the terrific graveyard-ranging bahurUpa bhairava and his wife, a special mantra of the supreme Anandabhairava, the 8-handed amR^itasUrya invocation and the formulae derived from the kaTha yajurveda.</description>

      <description>Upon the great snake shesha sleeps the great god viShNu, even as the the kalpa wears out. He stirs only when the waters rise and threaten to sink the world plane. This shesha is time and hence he is called ananta. Thus, when viShNu sleeps on the coils of the great world snake he is experiencing the cyclic passage of time.
Once the great god vAyu and the world snake ananta had a contest of strength.</description>
