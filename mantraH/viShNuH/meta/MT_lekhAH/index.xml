      <description>The great Kashmirian author in his text the dashAvatAracharitra which was written in 1066 AD describes the conditions that would prevail on the earth just before the coming of kalki.
“The Turushkas, Pathans, Daradas and dwellers of Shakastan will cause the earth to decay as do the leper his open oozing sores. Every direction overrun by the dreadful mlechChas, the earth will resound with the clash of swords drawn in combat and her soil will be soaked with blood.</description>

The below material arose as a collaborative venture in course of extended discussions with KR.

The winter solstice/year beginning in the last part of shraviShTha (1300 BCE)
The three great categories of gods in the veda and beyond Though absent in the extant Iranian texts, the oldest Indo-Aryan texts recognize the presence of three major categories of deva-s — the vasu-s, rudra-s and Aditya-s. This triad is mentioned on a number of occasions in the R^igveda.</description>

      <description>The bauddhas have internalized the last incarnation of viShNu, the all-destroying kalki or pramati who is said to annihilate the mlecchas and dasyus and restore the world to the Aryas. The kAlachakra tantra of the unclean upachInAchAra stream gives a highly remarkable account of the end of the yuga. It’s parallels to the mainstream Hindu version are unmistakable and appears to have been clearly derived from it [It is even possible that there was a now lost Hindu version which might have been a closer precursor of the version in the kAlachakra tantra].</description>

The earth with its mountains, cities, forests and waterbodies are in his tusks, his grunts are sarasvatI (vAgIshI). The air is his breath and the sun and moon are his right and left hands.

His belly is [made of] the vasus, in his ear are the directions, the ashvins are his eyes, in his feet is the lotus born [brahma], in his heart is viShNu and in his mouth is shiva.</description>

      <title>The snake of viShNu</title>

      <description>Upon the great snake shesha sleeps the great god viShNu, even as the the kalpa wears out. He stirs only when the waters rise and threaten to sink the world plane. This shesha is time and hence he is called ananta. Thus, when viShNu sleeps on the coils of the great world snake he is experiencing the cyclic passage of time.
Once the great god vAyu and the world snake ananta had a contest of strength.</description>
