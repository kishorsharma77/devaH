      <description>The eldest son of the great king of Nepal, pR^ithivi nArAyaNa shahA (who defeated the British and founded the Nepal Kingdom until its recent destruction by Marxists), pratApa siMha, compiled a voluminous work on the mantra shAstra during his brief life. As a companion to this a collection of pictures for the dhyAna-s on various deities was prepared by the artists in Nepal. A copy of this collection with R1’s father is of considerable interest in terms of tradition Hindu dhyAna art of which not many old samples survive.</description>
