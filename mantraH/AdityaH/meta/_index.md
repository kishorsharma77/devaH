- सविता प्रेरकतमः। 
- वरुणः पाशवान्।
- मित्र ऋतनियामकः।
- भगो भागकृत्।
- पूषा दन्तवर्जितः। Pan इति पाश्चात्येषु। शूद्रो वर्णेनेति क्वचित्।
  - "Arjuna says that brahman, dhAtR^i and puShaN are left out because they are not slayers. He's wrong about puShaN probably because the Mbh is already far removed from the RV where puShaN was capable of causing fear - the bharadvAja-s invoke him in the midst of battle. Ironically, his greek ortholog Pan is the root of panic & is said to have put fear into the Iranians on behalf of his yavana votaries when they clashed at Marathon."
