      <description>The sUta asked “O great kshatriya narrate to me the effects of displeasing the the fierce god gaNapati.”
The descendent of the great manu, the law giver, said ” The displeasure of vinAyaka is of terrible consequence. The 6 ferocious vinAyakas, namely shAla, kaTa~nkaTa, kUShmANDa, rAjaputra, sammita and devayajana can seize a person at anytime. The person immediately shows a variety of strange behaviors- he or she may start pounding clumps of soil with the hand, cutting grass, writing on ones own body and dreaming of waters, men with shaved heads, camels, pigs and asses.</description>

      <description>The gaNesha purANa has the 4 fold incarnations of gaNapati. They are:
1) vinAyaka in the kR^itayuga. 3 demons dhUmrAkSha, narAntaka and devAntaka assume great power and spread terror. So gaNapati is born of kAshyapa and his wife. He has a 10 handed form with lion vAhana and slays these asuras in a great battle at kAshi.
2)mayureshvara in the tretayuga. A demon called sindhu swallowed a pot of amR^ita he had obtained from rudra and became invincible.</description>
