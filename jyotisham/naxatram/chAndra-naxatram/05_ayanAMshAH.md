- अयनांश\-सूचिः \-  प्रारम्भस्थाने अयनांश-चिन्ता, Swiss Ephemeris सारः[अत्र](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773508), सूचिर्[अत्र](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swephprg.htm#_Toc471829106)।
- Other Spica/Citra (the actual star) tradition
  - Spica roughly at 0 Libra
      - Approximated by Lahiri ayanamsha (as it's fixed at 21 March 1956)
  - Spica/Citra at polar longitude 180°
    - swe.TRUE_CITRA was what was intended by the calendar reform committee - sticking to swe.SIDM_LAHIRI does not make theoretical sense, and practically, the difference between the two is not much (as of 2000-s).
- True mUlA
- True pushya
- प्राचीन एव सूर्यसिद्धान्ते तु वर्तते। वेदाङ्गज्योतिषे?
