In India there is at present a terrible calendar confusion. 

For official purposes, India has been using the Gregorian calendar since the imposition of the British rule in 1757. As the Gregorian calendar, on account of historic reasons, has attained the status of a World Calendar, it is still being used for official purposes after the attainment of Independence. There is a proposal sponsored by India before the UNO for the intro duction of a new World Calendar for civil and administrative purposes in place of the Gregorian calendar, which is inconvenient and unscientific (vide C $2.7). 

During the period of Moslem supremacy (1200-1757), the lunar Hejira calendar had been used. both for administrative as well as for Moslem religious purposes, except for a short period (1556-1630), when on the initiative of the Emperor Akbar, its use was prohibited and a form of the Iranian solar calendar (the Jelali calendar), under the name Tarikh Ilāhi, was intro duced. The Hejira calendar is now used only by the followers of Islam for fixing up the dates of their religious festivals. 

Before the advent of Moslem domination, the different states of India used a bewildering variety of calendars for civil as well as religious purposes of which a detailed account is given in C $5. The inscriptions of Indian kings from the first century A.D. to medieval times are dated according to these calendars, and it is often a headache for the Indologist to find out the starting point of the eras used in these calendars. 

Most of these calendars have gone out of use for civil purposes, but some are being still used for fixing up the dates and moments of religious festivals of communities following different. schools of Hinduism and other religions having their origin in India (Buddhism, Jainism). They use different eras, different year-beginnings, and sometimes different methods of calculations based on the three Siddhantas (scientific astronomical treatises), viz., the Sūrya, the ārya, and the Brahma, all dating from ancient and medieval times. 

These practices often produce a bewildering confusion in fixing up dates and moments of observance of the religious festivals, of which some detailed examples are given later. The Calendar Reform Committee was asked to make a study of the various Hindu religious calendars, and recommend to the Government a Unified National Calendar for Hindu religious purposes for the whole of India. The Committee has now finished its labours, and presents its report to the Government. The main points are summarized below: 

The Hindu religious calendar is mainly luni-solar, i.e., the seasons are fixed by the solar calendar, while the dates and moments are fixed according to the lunar calendar pegged on to it. 

The calendar therefore depends on the science of astronomy which has evolved methods for correctly predicting the positions of the sun, the moon, and the planets (the Ephemerides). The astronomical part of the calculations should be the same for calendars used by all nations. But this is not the whole story ; for the calendar also depends on convention, which varies widely from country to country and from state to state. 

Let us give some idea of the Science as well as of the Conventions in use for the solar and the lunar calendars respectively. For the solar calendar : 

- (1) The year should be properly defined, and the year-length taken should be astronomically correct. 
- (2) The seasons should be properly defined, and should start on proper dates. 
- (3) The day should start from midnight. 

An examination of Chap. XIV of the Surya Siddhānta (vide C$ 5.6) shows that the author of this famous treatise accepted these principles and laid down the following rules for the compilation of a calendar : 

- (1) The year should start from the instant when the sun crosses the vernal equinoctial point and the length of the year should therefore be tropical (sāyana). 
- (2) The seasons should consist of two solar months, each defined by the time taken by the sun to traverse 30° of the sun's path (the ecliptic). 
- (3) The day should be from midnight (ardharātråka system) for purposes of astronomical calculations. 



These principles do not alone suffice to define the calendar, for the year does not consist of a whole number of days, but its length (length of the tropical year) is approximately 365.2422 mean solar days. The time taken by the sun to traverse 30° of the arc of the ecliptic varies from 29.44 days to 31.46 days. 

The Calendar Committee has tried to rectify this fundamental error, by recommending, as laid down by the Sūrya Siddhānta, that the year should begin on the day after the vernal equinox, and the year-length should be sāyana. 

For civil purposes, both the year and the month should consist of a whole number of days, and the civil day ( sāvana ), according to Hindu religious practices, should start from sunrise. To achieve these purposes, different conventions have been used in different states which account partly for calendar confusion ( vide C 85:6). 

But the most serious mistake has been in the length of the year taken by the Sūrya Siddhānta, a standard astronomical compilation having its beginning from the 4th century A.D. The year-length adopted is 365.25876 days, which is presumably sidereal, but even then the length is wrong by + 0.00240 days. But as is pointed out in C $ 56, the Sarya Siddhanta lays down definitely that the year-length should be tropical which, according to modern measurements, should have approximately 365.2422 days, but this rule has been misinterpreted. 

The mistakes in astronomical constants (e.g., in the fixing up of the length of the year or months) are common in all ancient astronomical treatises, whether Indian or occidental, but in the West, the correct values were obtained later by refined observations during medieval times and were then adopted for calendar calculations by edicts of dictators like Julius Caesar or Pope Gregory XIII on the advice of astronomers. In India, astronomical observations stopped from about 1200 A.D. after the advent of the Turkish invaders, when Indian observatories were either destroyed or abandoned by the astronomers and calendar making fell into the hands of astrologers, who had to depend on ancient treatises. 

But a far more potent cause for the adherence to the wrong value was the failure, on the part of the Indian astronomers, to grasp the real nature of the phenomenon of Precession of Equinoxes (vide C $ 4:10). In this, they were not alone, for the false notions about this phenomenon were not abandoned even in Europe till the advent of Newton (1687). 

The Indian year is thus longer than the tropical year by 0.01656 days, and this error has been accumulating for nearly 1400 years with the result that the solar year, instead of starting on the day following the vernal equinox (21st March) as it did in the time of Varahamihira starts nearly 23-24 days later. Thus the year beginning as laid down by our almanac-makers has lost all connection with the actual year-beginning (the day following the vernal equinoctial day) as contemplated by the Sūrya Siddhanta, and the festivals as given by the Indian almanacs are being celebrated very frequently in wrong seasons. If Sarat Pūrimā is celebrated in the Hemanta season, as would happen in the year 1955, it is obvious that our almanacs are following neither the Scriptures nor Science. 

## LENGTHS OF THE SOLAR MONTHS : 

The Hindu solar month-lengths vary from 29 to 32, as the time of passing 30° of the ecliptic varies, accord ing to older data given in the Sarya Siddhanta from 29.32 days to 31.64 days. These varying lengths, as is well-known, can be understood only from Kepler's first two laws, which were explained fully by Newton in 1687 on the basis of dynamics and law of universal gravitation, but these laws and their explanation were unknown to astronomers in 400 A.D. Further these month-lengths are different in the three Siddhāntas be cause they were calculated according to three different formulæ. On account of the ignorance of Kepler's laws. and of the shift of the equinoctial lines in the Earth's orbit ( vide C $ 5:6) the ancient astronomers probably assumed that the times of passage through 30° as calculated according to formulæ given by them would be valid for all times. But we now know this assumption to be incorrect, and cannot stick to the lengths as given in the Siddhantas, which also differ amongst themselves. 

Further, all the numbers expressing month-lengths are fractional, and different states, vix., Bengal, Orissa, Tamil Nad use different conventions for defining the day of the solar samkrānti ( vide C $ 5:6) i.e., the civil day (sunrise to sunrise) which should be regarded as the day when the sun passes successive 30° of arc, beginning from the Hindu zero-point. The different conventions have their own merits, let the orthodox Bengalee, Oriya, or Tamil Pandit argue it out amongst themselves, but we feel that a convention which makes the solar month vary from 29 to 32 is very inconvenient for civil life, and we are quite sure that if the authors of the Siddhāntas were aware of Kepler's Laws and the shifting of equinoctial lines on the Earth's orbit, they would never have prescribed rules which would make the number of days in a solar month vary from 29 to 32. We have, therefore, assigned lengths of 30 and 31 days to the months. But the moment of the sun's traversing any multiple of the 30th degree from the vernal equinoctial point has been indicated.

We have recommended the SAKA era, as this is the era par excellence used by all Indian astronomers, and had been used and is still used for calendaric calculations all over India, since the days of the Ujjain astronomers (first century A.D.). This is the only era used in all Indian scientific treatises. For other eras see C $ 5.8. 

The new solar calendar is scientific, applicable to all parts of India, and follows the Sūrya Siddhānta in all essential points, and is absolutely sound as regards its astronomical basis. The conventions have been revised with the sole object of having a uniform system for the whole of India. 

## THE LUNAR CALENDAR : 

The lunar calendar depends on the correct calculation of the moments of conjunction (Amāvasyā), opposition (Paurnamāsi) and of the tithis (i.e., the moments when the moon gains 12° or its integral multiple on the sun). The Indian calendar-makers use for this purpose the formulæ on lunar motion given in the three Siddhāntas. But as these are known to be inaccurate, they use certain corrections called bīja introduced by later Indian astronomers. 

It is now well-known that the motion of the moon is very irregular and complex, and therefore the moon is very inconvenient as a time-marker. For this reason the moon was completely discarded by the Egyptians as a time-marker 3000 years before Christ. The ancient Egyptian solar calendar is the basis from which the present Gregorian calendar has sprung. 

But other ancient and modern nations did not follow the Egyptians, and it became the chief duty on the part of their astronomers to observe the moon from day to day, and evolve mathematical formula from which the ephemerides of the moon could be calculated. As Neugebauer has shown (Exact Sciences in Antiquity), ancient Babylonian astronomy (700 B.C. 300 B.C.) was largely centred round devising, , from actual observations of the moon's position, mathematical formulæ, which would enable them to calculate the longitude of the moon in advance. These attempts were continued by the Greeks, Indians, Arabs and medieval Europeans and are still being continued. For the calculation of the moon's position, formulæ are employed which require' twenty pages of printed matter, containing about 1,500 terms in all. They have been evolved as measurements have become more refined and accurate, with the progress of astronomy ; and were, of course, unknown to astronomers of ancient times. 

## Effect of Indian Lunar Calendars

As the orthodox Indian calendar-maker still uses the old formulæ dating from 400 A.D., his calculations of the ending moments of tithis do not agree with those given by the Nautical Almanacs, which are based on modern formulæ and are verified by actual observations as shown in the following example: 

(Original pdf here contains a list of discrepencies in tithi boundaries)

Some of the Indian calendar-makers are aware of these discrepancies, and give the ending moments of tithis according to the Nautical Almanac. But all of them give the moments of beginning and ending of lunar and solar eclipses according to the Nautical Almanac, as times calculated according to the Siddhantas may be grossly inaccurate, and the mistakes would at once catch public attention and lower their prestige. In the words of one of our colleagues (Dr. Gorakh Prasad), these almanac-makers are like bicycle-riders riding without lamps, who get down from their cycles on street corners, just to avoid being caught by the Police. 

The calculations of tithis given by the Calendar Committee follow the Nautical Almanac, and are based on correct positions of the moon and the sun. 

The Committee has made another radical departure. According to conventions laid down in Dharmaśāstras, a religious festival is to be observed in a locality when the prescribed tithi is current at a particular hour of the civil day of that locality. But on the same day and hour, the tithi may vary from locality to locality and this, taken with the mistakes in calculating tithi according to ancient methods, may produce a day's difference in fixing up the dates of religious festivals. 

If the different almanac-makers calculate the tithi not according to the Nautical Almanac, but according to different Indian astronomical treatises, the moment of the tithi may differ by as much as five hours, and the same festival, say the Dussera (or Durga Pujā) may be fixed on two successive days in the same city, as happend in Calcutta in the case of Durga Pujā in 1952 and Sarasvati Puja in 1953. Which set of Pandits is to be followed by the Government in fixing up the date of holidays in such cases ? 

The Committee has taken the view that the ending moments of tithis should be given according to modern calculations (which would naturally agree with Nautical . Almanacs) and the tithi current for the Central Station ( 82.5° E. Long. and 23° 11' N. Lat.) should be the tithi for the whole of India. This is a very sensible proposition, for if we have to follow the Siddhāntic convention to the letter, then even if the calculations are given correctly, every station would have its own tithi, just as according to Relativity, every moving particle has its own time. But the Pandits are not correct in their own claims that they are following the Sāstras correctly ; for a Banaras almanac is according to Siddhāntic convention, true only for Banaras, but may on certain occasions, be incorrect for a place even a mile from Banaras. So the Siddhāntic convention was laid down in an age when there was no printing presses and no printed almanacs, but almanacs were to be fixed up and recited for every locality by local astrologers according to their own calculations. If it has still to be followed, every village should print its own almanac. In laying down the principle that the whole of India should follow the tithi calculated for a central locality, we are no more violating the Siddhāntic convention than the calculators of the Banaras or Calcutta almanacs which have currency over wide areas far away from their own city. 

In course of fixing the festivals of different states in the Reformed Calendar, it has been found that different conventions are followed in different states in the matter of fixation of the same festival. For example it may be quoted that in 1954 Janmāṣtami was observed on the 21st August in North India and on the 20th, 21st and 22nd in other parts of India. Rāmanavami was observed in Bengal on 24th March, 1953, while it was celebrated on the preceding day in upper India. The calculation of the ending moment of tithi is not the cause for such discrepancies in this case, but the difference in convention is solely responsible. We have followed all these differences of conventions in the state-wise fixation of the dates of festivals, as far as practicable. We are however of opinion that a uniform convention should be followed throughout India in this matter also. In order to explore the possibilities of such unification, it is desirable that necessary steps should be taken by the Government. The Ephemerides Committee which we have recommended may be entrusted with this work. 

## APPOINTMENT OF THE COMMITTEE 

The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research appointed in November 1952, a Calendar Reform Committee with:Prof. M.N. Saha, F.R.S., as Chairman and six other members (vide their letter No. 144 Bd. (G. P.)/52 dated the 11th November, 1952, intimating the decision of the Governing Body meeting held on 13. 8. 52) as follows:

The terms of referencë are as follows :-. 

The Committee has been entrusted with the task of "examining all the existing calendars which are being followed in the country at present and after a scientific study of the subject, submit proposals for an accurate and uniform calendar for the whole of India." 

## COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
The Committee had three meetings and have now finalized their recommendations to Government. 

1. The first meeting was held at 10 A.M. on Saturday, the 21st February, 1953, in the C.S.I.R. Secretariat Buildings, Old Mill Road, New Delhi, and it continued also on the 23rd February. The Prime Minister sent a message and Shri K. D. Malaviya Deputy Minister, Natural Resources and Scientific Research, inaugurated the meeting. The proceedings of the meeting will be found in Annexure I. 

After discussion on the several points mentioned by the Chairman, the Committee arrived at certain decisions and adopted the following resolutions : 

- (1) The tropical year of 365.2422 days should be adopted for the purpose of calendar making. 
- (2) A scientific civil solar calendar to be hence forth called the National Calendar for purposes of dating should have its first day after the vernal equinox day, i.e., on the 22nd March. But for religious purposes the calculations may start 23° 15' ahead. of the V. E. point, for sometime to come ( as a conces sion to the prevailing custom ). 
- (3) The Saka era should be adopted for the reformed Indian Calendar. 
- (4) All calculations should be made for a central station in India situated at 823° East Longitude and 23° 11' North Latitude (latitude of Ujjain). 

 respect to the stars ; otherwise the nakṣatra divisions would lose all connections with the stars or star-groups contained in those nakṣatras. For this purpose, the ayanamsa of 23° 15' should relate to 21st March, 1956, the middle of the five yearly period. 

The calculations of the Reformed Calendar for five years, have been revised in the light of the above decisions. 

III. The third and the final meeting of the Calendar Reform Committee was held on the 13th September, 1954, at 100 A.M. in the C.S.I.R. Building, New Delhi. In this meeting, the Reformed Calendar for five years, the resolutions so far adopted and the final report were approved for submission. The proceedings will be found as Annexure III. 

(5) The day should be reckoned from midnight to midnight of the central station for civil purposes, but for religious purposes the local sunrise system may be followed. 

The Committee made the following recommenda tions to the Government of India : 

(i) A tentative national calendar for the whole of India should be prepared for five years in advance, showing dates, days, months, tithi's (lunar days) and naksatras (lunar asterisms). 

(ii) Steps should be taken to compile an Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac by the Government of India showing in advance positions of the sun, the moon, planets and other important heavenly bodies.. 

(iii) There should be a National Observatory at a suitable place provided with modern equipments, apparatus and time-service. 

The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research accepted the first recommendation and appointed Shri N. C. Lahiri and Prof. R. V. Vaidya, members of the Committee, as whole-time workers for the purpose of implementation of this recommendation, and also provided them with necessary assistants. The experi mental National Calendar of India for the five years 1954-55 to 1958-59 A.D. (Saka 1876 to 1880) has accord ingly been prepared and will be found as Part B. 

II. The second meeting of the Calendar Reform Committee was held on the 8th March, 1954, at 10 A.M. in the C.S.I.R. Building, New Delhi, In this meeting the detailed methods of preparation of the Reformed Calendar were discussed and certain resolutions were adopted which will be found in the proceedings of the meeting given in Annexure II. The question of adopting variable ayanānsa was discussed, but no final decision could be taken in the meeting. The Chairman decided the question later after taking opinion of members by correspondence. The following are the principal points decided : 

(1) Caitra (pronounced as Chaitra) should be the first solar month of the year starting on the day following vernal equinox, and the names of the solar months should be Caitra, Vaiśākha, etc. 

(2) The lengths of the civil solar months be fixed as follows: 

EXAMINATION OF THE EXISTING CALENDARS 

With a view to examining the existing calendars, as per terms of reference, all the Pañcanga makers in different states of India were requested by a Press communique' issued by the C.S.I.R. in March 1953, to send 3 copies of their Pañcăngas covering the year 1953-54. As a result of this request many calendars were received from different parts of India, a list of which is given as Annexure V. Some difficulty was experienced in studying the exact nature of these calendars due to language difficulty and want of the required data in these calendars. Accordingly a questionnaire was issued in November 1953, to all these and also to some other calendar makers whose addresses were known, requesting them to furnish certain data relating to their calendars. The questionnaire together with the replies so far received will be found as Annexure VI. 

SUGGESTIONS RECEIVED FOR CALENDAR REFORM 

We have received various suggestions for calendar reform from different persons. A summary of these suggestions will be found in Annexure VII. All the suggestions have been examined in the Committee meetings before finalization of the recommendations of the Committee. Some of the suggestions favour the continuance of the present inaccurate system of calendar making. But on the other hand there are many persons and organizations who have suggested that accurate and scientific calendar, as recommended by the Committee should be adopted. 

Caitra~ 30 & 31 days (31 days in a leap-year), Vaisakha-31, Jyaiṣtha-31, Aṣadha-31 Śrāvana–31, Bhadra-31, Ăśvina--30, Kartika-30, Agrahāyana--30, Parıṣa-30, Magha-30, and Phalguna-30 days. Leap years should correspond with the leap-years 

of the Gregorian calendar. 

(3) The nakṣatras should be calculated with a variable ayanāmśa, so that they remain fixed with 

HOLIDAYS We have prepared tables ( vide B) giving dates of various religious festivals and holidays observed in different states of India in four categories,

viz., solar, luni-solar, Christian and Moslem. Many festivals and holidays are common in all states, others are different. A festival which is considered very important in one state (e.g., Dussera or Durga Pujā in Bengal ) may be considered secondary in other regions (e.g., in Western India). There are holidays confined only to certain states. It is hoped that the Central Government may make choice of such holidays which should be considered as Central, for obviously they cannot accept all holidays current in India, as there would then be few working days left. 

On account of shortness of time, it has not been found possible to give planetary data except the heliacal rising and setting of Jupiter and Venus. These 

are not necessary for calculation of the dates and moments of religious festivals, except in a few rare cases like the Kumbha Mela. The Ephemerides Committee, if it comes into existence, may be entrusted with this work. 

In the compilation of the Reformed Indian Calendar, we have received invaluable help from Sir Harold Spencer Jones, Astronomer Royal of the United Kingdom, who provided us with certain advance data facilitating our calculations. The grateful thanks of the Committee are due to him. We also wish to thank our correspondents, many of whom helped us with valuable data and information. 

FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE 

31 

» 

The calendar has got two distinct uses, viz., civil and religious. The Indian calendars, in the particular form it has assumed in different parts of the country, are used for the purpose of dating not only by the rural, but also by a large section of the urban popula tion. On account of the fact, as mentioned above, that the usage of one area differs from another, the Committee recommends that the unified National Calendar should be used uniformly in all states of India, for civil purposes wherever necessary, in place of local calendars.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CIVIL CALENDAR (1) The Saka era should be used in the unified national calendar. The year 1954-55 A.D. corresponds to 1876 Saka or in other words the year 1954 A.D. corresponds to 1875-76 Saka. 

(2) The year should start from the day following the vernal equinox day. 

(3) A normal year would consist of 365 days while a leap-year would have 366 days. After adding 78 to the Saka era, if the sum is divisible by 4, then it is a leap-year. But when the sum becomes a multiple of 100, it would be a leap-year only when it is. divisible by 400, otherwise it would be a common year. 

The years Śaka 1878, 1882, 1886, 1890, 1894 etc., are leap-years consisting of 366 days each. But the gears 2022, 2122, 2222 and again 2422, 2522, 2622 Saka are not leap-years, while 1922, 2322, 2722 Saka are leap-years. 

(4) Castra ( pronounced as Chaitra ) should be the first month of the year, and the lengths of the different months would be fixed as follows: 

Caitra 30 days (31 days in a leap-year ) Vaisakha 31 days Jyaiṣtha 31 * Āsādha

31 » 

 

In course of implementation of these recommenda tions, the states now having the solar calendar for civil and partly religious purposes which start the year from Vaisakha 1 ( April 14 ), will have to begin the year 23 days earlier, but the first month will be Cailra. The effect of this on the states are as follows: 

(6) As usual the lunar months for religious pur poses would commence from the moment of new-moon and would be named after the saura māsa in which the new-moon falls. If there be two new-moons during the period of a saura māsa, the lunar month beginning from the first new-moon is the adhika or mala and the lunar month beginning from the moment of the second new-moon is the suddha or nija, as usual. 

Bengal, Orissa, 

& Assam : 

Solar months start approximately seven days later than now, 

Tamil Nad : Solar months start approximately 

23 days earlier than now, for the month called Vaisakha (14th April-14th May) in Bengal and Orissa is called Chittirai or Caitra in Tamil Nad. 

Those who use the Caitrādi lunar calendar also for civil purposes, would however experience no great difficulty in adopting this unified calendar, as they have at present the beginning of their year varying from 15th March to 13th April, and the first month is Caitra. 

(7) The moments of moon's exit from a nakṣatra division of 13° 20' each or sun's entry into it, would be calculated with a variable ayanāmsa j.e., on the supposition that they are fixed with respect to the stars. The value of this ayanāinsa would amount to 23° 15' 0" on 21st March, 1956. Thereafter it would gradually increase with the usual annual rate, the mean value of which is about 50".27. 

These arrangements would ensure that the religious festivals, and observances determined by the sun (such as the Mahäviṣuva samkrānti, Uttarāyaṇa samkrānti, Dakṣināyana samkrānti) would follow astronomically correct seasons, but those determined by the lunar calendar would continue to be observed in times conforming to the present practice, and the correction we have introduced in the length of the year would prevent their further shift in relation to the seasons. 

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RELIGIOUS CALENDAR 

(5) The calculation of solar ( saura ) months necessary for determining the lunar months of the same name, will start 23° 15' ahead of the vernal equinoctial point. This tallies with the present practice of most almanac-makers. 

: The months would thus commence at the moments when the tropical longitude of the sun attains the following values : 

The dates of festivals have already shifted by 23 days from the seasons in which they were observed about 1400 years ago as a result of our almanac-makers having ignored the precession of the equinoxes. Although it may seem desirable that the entire amount of shifting should be wiped out at a time, we consider it expedient to maintain this as a constant difference and stop its further increase. As a result, there would at present be no deviation from the prevailing custom in the observance of the religious festivals. 

In the calculation of nakṣatras, however, we have adopted a variable ayanāmsa, so, that at the time of a particular nakṣatra the moon may be seen in the sky near the star or star-group of that name. This practice is being followed in our country from the Vedic times and is perfectly scientific.

It is hoped that at not a distant date, further reforms for locating the lunar and solar festivals in the seasons in which they were originally observed will be adopted. 

(8) The day should be reckoned from midnight to midnight of the central station (821° E. Long. and 23° 11' North Latitude) for civil purposes, but for religious purposes the local sunrise system may be followed. 

(9) For the purpose of all calculations, the longi tudes of the sun and the moon should be obtained by applying the most up to date and complete equations of their motions, so that they may tally with their observed values.

FURTHER RECOMMENDATIONS 

(10) Steps should be taken to compile an "Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac" by the Government of India, showing in advance, the positions of the sun, the moon, planets and other heavenly bodies. The Indian calendar-both civil and religious prepared according to the above recommendations should be included in that publication every year, 

to be the most suitable time for introduction of the reformed calendar throughout India.

Dissenting note to the report of the Committee by Dr. K. L. Daftari. 

A permanent Standing Committee to be called the Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac Committee may be constituted for this purpose and attached to a scientific department of the Government of India. 

(11) Steps should be taken to establish a Natio nal Astronomical Observatory at a suitable place, provided with modern equipment, apparatus and time-service. 

I agree with the final report of the Committee dissenting only on the following point. I hold that the fixed nakṣatras, though regarded as enjoined by the dharmaśāstras should not be taken into considera tion in fixing days of the religious functions, or the dharmaśāstras be regarded as enjoining the moving nakṣatras starting from a point 23° 15' ahead of the equinoctial point. I have given my reasons previously in my letters to the Chairman of the Committee, (a summary of which will be found as Annexure IV). 

We hope that the Government of India would make early arrangements for implementation of our recommendations. For this purpose the date 21st March, 1956 A.D., which is Caitra 1, 1878 Saka seems

exact observations of the sun, the moon and other heavenly bodies, which serve as time-keepers: 

Up to 1200 A.D., before India passed under foreign invaders, our astronomers at Ujjain and other centres, always took the trouble of correcting their calculations from direct observations of the heavenly bodies. But, after 1200 A.D., the indigonous centres of astronomical study were all broken up, and the new rulers did not take the trouble of setting up fresh centres till towards the end of the Moghul rule, when Maharja Jai Singh of Amber established five observatorios at Ujjain, Jaipur and other centres for astronomical studies after the pattern of the famous obser vatory of Ulugh Begh at Samarkand. Our calendar-makers, being for long left to their own resources, and having no astronomical observatories had to fall back for calculations on rules which were insufficient and incorrect and which vitiated all the results. Therefore, confusion crept in the calendars, and they have become diversified according to local usage and customs. This condition is representative of 800 years of suppression, and is symbolic of the history of India. 

Now that we are an independent nation and are making all efforts to bring about integration in our national life, it is obvious that an important item like the calendar cannot be left in the present confused state. We use for civil and administrative purposes the Gregorian Calendar which has been imposed by the British Rulers. This calendar is not their invention but like the Roman script, it was imposed on them by their Roman civilisers who got it partly from Egypt. On account of the dominance of the Christian powers during the last two centuries, it has become the World Calendar. But on principle it is a very inconvenient and unscientific calendar compared to ours, and needs reform. 

There is a proposal before the U.N.O. by the World Calendar Association for the revision of the Gregorian calendar. One of the tasks of the present Committee would be to make suggestions to this world-body for the evolution of a world calendar which will be scientific and can command the consent of all nations. Our Moham medan fellow citizens will continue to use the Hedjira calendar for fixing their religious holidays and we leave them there. The la bours of the present Calendar Committee is to make a scientific study of all the calendars of indigenous origin, and make suggestions for a unified calendar for the guidance of administration, for social purposes, and as far as practicable, for fixing up the religious holidays for India. I am assured by my astronomical friends assembled here that this is quite possible. We shall be looking forward to your evolving a formula which would be acceptable to the different people and States of India, and the Government of India will give serious considerations to the adoption of your proposals. I need hardly add that this should be based on science, should take due consideration of the customs and religious festivals in different parts of the country and at the same time would be a calendar which the different communities and States can adopt. 

While making those suggestions before you I am aware of the difficulties. Calendar reform can be suggested by scientists, but it can be carried into practice only by those who have religious or political authority. The ancient Roinan calendar could be reformed only by a dictator like Julius Caesar, and later on by the religious dictator of Christendom, Pope Gregory XIII, and the ancient luni-solar calondar only by the authority of the Prophet. But we are now under a democracy. Whatever proposals you may make would have to be submitted to the public for their opinion, and I am quite sure that our public would not resent any innovation simply because it is a new thing, just as they do not reject electricity or new machines. I hope the public response would be encouraging and the Government would find it possible to give serious consideration to your proposals." 

5. Prof. M. N. Saha, the Chairman, on behalf of the members of the Committee, expressed grateful thanks to the Prime Minister for his kind message. The Committee regretted that the Prime Minister could not personally inaugurate the deliberations of the Committee. Prof. Saha, however, assured the Committee that the Prime Minister had his heart and soul in the matter, and that he wanted the Committee to get on with its work and evolve scientific proposals for preparation of a uniform calendar for the whole of India and for the benefit of the country. 

6. The Chairman on behalf of the Committee, gratefully thanked the Deputy Minister for having graced the occasion by his presence and having inaugurated the work of the Committee. The Deputy Minister had laid down the lines on which the Committee may proceed. With the encouragement of the Government, the Committee hoped to be able to accomplish the desired objective, for without State support the discussions would be dead letter. 

7. The Chairman pointed out that in India there were 30 or more different calendars. In Banaras alone they had four calendars and it was quite common that important Hindu festivals like Ganesa Caturthi and Sarasvati Pujā were celebrated on different days in different parts of the country or even at the same city as happened this year at Calcutta. The Committee should aim at placing before the Government proposals for a uniform scientific calendar which would be acceptable to all. The task was not an easy matter. 

8. Tracing out the history of the movement for calendar reform, the Chairman said that the idea was not a new one. The Indian luni-solar calendar up to 400 A.D. was very crude, but great astronomers of India after 400 A.D. in Pataliputra, Bhilmal in Rajasthan and in Ujjain particularly had made very great contributions to mathematical knowledge, to astronomy and to other branches of science. They 

 

laid down the formulæ for the future generations and advised them to get their calculations verified by means of observations of the sun, the moon and the planets, which are our time-makers. 

13. The great pioneer of calendar-studies was Sankara Balakrishna Dixit, whose history of Bharatiya Jyotiṣa-Sastra is a standard authoritative work, but his work is in Marathi and unaccessible to majority of India. The Chairman expressed the hope that it should be translated into English for the use of all.* 

9. At the present moment, the Ahargana or the heap of days is in usage for accurate chronological calculations. The idea was first evolved by Hindu astronomers about 400 A.D. This was invented only in the 16th century in Europe by Joseph Scaliger. The Siddhantic astronomers started the year from the day after the Vernal Equinox but the older tradition was, as many Indian savants had pointed out, to begin the calendar from Winter Solstice. 

14. In Bengal, Madhab Chandra Chattopadhaya had been publishing the Visuddha Siddhānta Panjikā since 1890, in which all calculations were made according to modern accepted formulæ. Shri Nirmal Chandra Lahiri, a member of the Committee, has been continuing the work. 

10. Solar months which were invented about these times had not proved very convenient for use. The month-lengths varied from 29 to 32. The greatest difficulty has been caused by the use of the sidereal year and not the year of seasons, as the Hindu savants of those times either were unaware of the existence of the phenomenon of precession of equinoxes, or thought it was not unidirectional. The mistake was found by Munjāla and Sripats in the 10th and 11th centuries, when the Vernal Equinox had receded by seven to eight days, and they tried to persuade the astronomers to take to sāyana reckoning but the attempt was unsuccessful. The situation now is that the Vernal Equinox falls on 21st March but our year beginning which ought to fall on the following day, falls, actually on 13th or 14th April. Thus a mistake of 23 days had occurred in our calculation of seasons, or year-beginning. 

15. The problem of Indian Calendar Reform was also seriously examined at Banaras, the ancient seat of Indian culture and religion by the late Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, Shri Sampurnanand and others and the need for rectification of the present position was impressed upon. 

16. Thus, the idea of calendar reform had been going on for a long time in this country on a personal level. But as it affected all classes of people, effective reform can be carried out only on State level. But all were agreed that there should be a uniform national calendar for the whole of India. 

17. All our religious festivals are determined according to the lunar calendar which is pegged on to the present unsatisfactory solar calendar. Hence the task before the Committee is to devise a satisfactory solar calendar first and peg on to it a lunar calendar. 

11. The Chairman pointed out that it was for the Committee to discuss and decide whether the year was to be brought back by 23 days or to leave the mistake as it was and to retain a permanent constanterror. He also pointed out that such a mistake had occurred in Europe and corrections had to be introduced. The Gregorian year in 1582 was found to have an error of 10 days. Pope Gregory XIII advised that the 5th October should be called the 15th October. This was adopted by the Catholics. Though the Protestant countries at first did not accept this move, simply because it came from the Pope, but 170 years later England had to accept the correction by legislation. Russia accepted the Gregorian calendar only after the Bolshevik resolution. 

18. The Chairman pointed out that there was a good deal of dissatisfaction even with the Gregorian calendar, though it has attained the status of a world calendar. One of the main drawbacks of this calendar is that the ending of the year does not correspond with the winter solstice day. There are several proposals for reforming the Gregorian calendar. According to one proposal, every month was to be of 4 weeks, and therefore of 28 days and thirteen months would make a year of 364 days. One day, the year-end day, was to be without any name and named simply the year-end day. In leap years, there was to be an additional year-raiddle day, without any weekday name. Every month was to begin on a Sunday. According to the other proposal the year was to consist of 4 quarters, each of 91 days. Each quarter was to be divided into three months of 31, 30, 30 days. The year-end day, and the year-middle day in leap years were to be the same as before. 

12. In India, the idea of Indian Calendar reform originated from Maharashtra Lokamanya Shri Bal Gangadhar Tilak well-known as a great political figure of the last generation was, as is well-known, a great savant and antiquarian and initiated calendar reform in Maharashtra. He started a new reformed calendar which is still being published at Poona. 

* The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research has since made arrangements for having the book translated into English and Prof. R. V. Vaidya, a member of the Committee has been entrusted with the work. 

12 

 

19. The World Calendar Association of New York, U.S.A., had a proposal before the United Nations Organization to evolve a uniform calendar for the whole world. Sir Harold Spencer Jones, the Astro nomer-Royal of U.K. and other eminent astronomers had expressed their support of the proposals of W.C.A.. They wanted to effect this change from 1956. This. proposal, if accepted, would produce great convenience and simplicity but succession of day reckoning by. the cycle of the seven day week will have to be given up. 

20. The Committee had to discuss all these matters, and its function was to submit proposals to the Govern ment of India and devise ways and means of achieving the desired scientific calendar. The Chairman said that the Committee could count upon the sympathy of the Hon'ble the Prime Minister and the Deputy Minister and of the Government of India. The proposals to be discussed are :-- 

(a) Whether a number of astronomical com 

puters would have to be appointed for compiling an All-India Calendar for five years in advance on the lines which will be suggested by the Committee. Whether steps should be taken to compile an Indian Ephemeris for the use of the calendar-makers, the Navy and the Air 

Force. (c) Establishment of a Central Astronomical 

Observatory by the Government equipped 

with modern instruments and apparatus. 21. The Chairman said that modern apparatus like the ammonia clock, the quartz clock should be installed in the observatory for the betterment of the time-service and for geophysical studies. 

22. The Chairman said that geophysical studies with the aid of accurate clocks was of very great fundamental importance. All along scientists had studied only the surface of the earth. But now the study of the interior of the earth has attained great significance and with the aid of accurate clocks, it has been found that the period of rotation of the earth undergoes sudden variations which may be due to something going on inside the earth. 

23. The Chairman emphasized that a reformed calendar and an Indian Ephemeris will be of advantage not only for civil, social and national life but will also be of great use for the army, the navy and the air force. He thanked the Hon'ble Deputy Minister on behalf of the Committee. (At this stage the Deputy Minister left the meeting.) 

24. The Chairman informed the Committee that he had received a number of good wishes for the deliberations of the Committee from not only India but also from several European countries as well as from Brazil, Canada, etc. The President of the W.C.A. Miss Achelis, had also sent her goodwill message. 

25. The general question as to whether or not Government of India should undertake reform of the various Hindu calendars in India and have one uniform calendar for the whole of India was discussed. 

Dr. Gorakh Prasad said that it will be in the fitness of things for the Government to initiate the reform and pointed out that only minimum necessary changes in the prevailing custom should be effected to avoid public resentment and opposition. He emphasized this point. He also pointed out that in the past there had been hero worship and guru-worship and due to personal animosity and financial considerations several anomalies have crept in. Even today pancānga making was a financial proposition. Astrology flourished on the principle “Remember it if it fits and forget it if it misses." 

Shri Lahiri said that proposals concerning religious festivals should be got ratified by eminent Pandits. 

Prof. Vaidya said that as we have got a democracy, Government of the people and by the people, Government should undertake the reform. 

Dr. Daftari pointed out, however, that the Committee had been definitely assigned the task of submitting proposals to the Government for a reform in the calendar and as such the general question whether the Government should undertake it or not did not arise. He laid emphasis on the fact that our present calendars were absurd in the sense that the seasons were moving backward and wanted that this should be stopped. 

The Committee resolved that a National Solar Calendar for civil purposes should be prepared by the Committee under the auspices of the Central Government and that the lunar pancānga should be pegged on to this calendar. 

26. Whether India should support the proposals of the W.Ç.A. was discussed. 

. Dr. Gorakh Prasad was not in favoar. Shri Karandikar opined that India should evolve a National Calendar and the whole world may follow it. 

Discussion on this point was postponed ; the Committee did not favour the Gregorian calendar. 

*. The proposal of World Calendar Reform sponsored by the Government of India, is now under the active consideration of the ECOSOC of the United Nations. 

27. Sāyana or Nirayana Reckoning. 

The Chairmarf pointed out that the sāyana year was 365*2422 days and the Gregorian year was 

 

13 

365*2425 days. Thus the error in adopting the Gregorian leap year system would be only 1 day in 3300 years. He favoured the adoption of the sāyana reckoning. 

The Committee agreed with the Chairman and resolved to adopt the sāyana reckoning for the reformed calendar. 

All the members of the Committee agreed to the resolution except Dr. Gorakh Prasad who recorded his disagreement with the resolution. 

Dr. Gorakh Prasad was of the opinion that for civil purposes also the year should begin on the same day as for religious purposes. He thought that the existence of two Indian solar years would create confusion instead of producing any beneficial effects. 

30. Length of the Months. 

Shri Karandikar's view was that the time taken by the sun to go through 30° on the zodiac should be the length of the month. The Chairman pointed out that the lengths of months would vary from 29 to 32, and would cause much inconvenience. 

28. Beginning of the Year. 

The Chairman pointed out that there was an error of 23 days in the present calendars and desired to know whether the Committee would favour shifting of the year for the reformed calendar by 23 days to put an end to this mistake. 

Dr. Gorakh Prasad pointed out that a suggestion to shift the year back by 23 days would meet with very great opposition from the public who will certainly resent such a move. He was not in favour of the shift. 

Dr. Daftari opined that this error of 23 days can be ... left over as it was and allowed to remain as a 

permanent constant error. The increase of the error should be stopped. 

Shri Karandikar said that the Government should have a solar year beginning from Vernal Equinox. He desired the length of the year to be tropical. He suggested that after shifting back by 23 days the V. E. day, viz., 21st March may be the beginning of the solar year, but the pancāngas may start the lunar year from Caitra suklādi. 

The Committee agreed to have 5 solar months of 31 days and 7 months of 30 days in an ordinary year and in a leap year 6 solar months of 31 days and six months of 30 days. 

31. Era. 

The Chairman pointed out that the Vikrama era was never used by astronomers and in different States, there were different year beginnings for the Vikrama Samvat era. For all calculations the Indian astronomers have always used the saka era. 

Dr. Daftari said that the Siddhantas used the Kaliyuga era. Sri Karandikar was of the opinion that either Kali or Kalpa era should be used. 

The Committee resolved that the current Saka Era should be adopted for the reformed Indian calendar. 

29. Vernal Equinox & Winter Solstice. 

· The Chairman said that V.E. was on 21st March and that W.S. was on 22nd December. The problem was whether the Committee favoured V.E. or W.S. as the beginning of the solar year, 

Dr. Daftari said that W.S. is good for the civil calendar. In any case, the seven-day week should not be touched which was agreed to by the Committee. Dr. Gorakh Prasad, Prof. Vaidya and Shri Lahiri favoured the V.E. as the commencement for the solar year. 

Stronon lers 

over 

The following resolution was adopted : 

The Committee recommends to the Government of India that a scientific Civil Solar Calendar to be henceforth called the National Calendar for purposes of dating should have its first day after the Vernal Equinox day, viz., on the 22nd March, but for religious purposes in places where solar calendar is used, 13th or 14th April may be the first day of the year for some time to come (as a concession to the prevailing custom). 

32. Reckoning of Day: 

Two systems now prevalent are (a) reckoning the day from mid-night to mid-night and (6) from sun-rise to sun-rise. The Chairman favoured the mid-night system as the advantages in this system were : 

that the astronomers all over the world, 

including our ancient astronomers used it ; (ii) it was an international system ; (iii) complications due to latitude did not come 

in this system. Dr. Daftari, Shri Karandikar, Prof. Vaidya and Dr. Gorakh Prasad, however, were in favour of reckoning the day from sun-rise to sun-rise ; even though latitude and longitude had to be considered in calculations. Shri Lahiri was in favour of reckoning the day from mid-night to mid-night. 

14 

 

The Committee resolved that in the Indian system of time reckoning, the day should be reckoned from mid-night to mid-night at an All-India Central Station for dating purposes only, but for religious and other purposes the day may begin from sun-rise of the Central Station ; but tables showing local sun - rise for important stations should be given. 

should favour a uniform tethi for the whole of India. Shri Karandikar however opposed the proposition and pointed out that the tithi depended on sunrise and so on local time and could never be uniform for the whole of India. 

It was resolved that in the National Calendar, tithi should be given for the Central Station and the calculations of time should be given in hours and minutes. 

38. Nakshatra. 

33. All-India Central Station. 

The Chairman pointed out that it was necessary for international purposes that Indian time should be 51 hrs. ahead of the Universal Time (Greenwich Time). The Committee considered the question of location of the Central Astronomical Station. 

Prof. Vaidya and Shri Karandikar put up maps and atlases. Prof. Vaidya proposed Ujjain on tradi tional grounds or Jubbalpore on geographical grounds. Dr. Gorakh Prasad and Shri Karandikar suggested Ujjain, while Shri Lahiri suggested 224°N. Latitude. It was decided that a place (821°E. of Greenwich) and having the latitude of Ujjain (viz. 23° 11'N) be recognised as the Central Station for India. 

The Chairman preferred an Indian calendar without nakṣatras being indicated. Dr. Daftari however said that the nakṣatras should be specified and that Atvint should start with Meṣa. It was resolved that the nakṣatras should be given with Asvinī starting with Mesa. 

34. Lunar Calendar. 

The Committee agreed that the lunar months should be new-moon ending, and the lunar year should begin with Caitra. Sukla-pratipat. 

39. Recommendations to the 

Government of India. Resolutions proposed by the Chairman and un animously passed by the Committee :-- 

1. A tentative National Calendar for the whole 

of India should be prepared for five years in advance, showing dates, days, months, tithis and nakṣatras. (Five years in advance was necessary to find out the practical implications and difficulties which may be caused by the occurrence of 

leap years and intercalary months.) 2. Steps should be taken to compile an Indian 

Ephemeris by the Government of India showing in advance positions of the Sun, the Moon, the planets and other important 

heavenly bodies. 3. There should be a National Observatory at 

a suitable place provided with modern equipment, apparatus and time-service. 

35. The year for Religious Calendar. 

Dr. Daftari said that for the sake of convenience the first point of the zodiac should be 23° 21' ahead of the real Vernal Equinox, and that all calculations should be made on this basis. Shri Lahiri pointed out that in Bengal they had 23° 12'. 

It was decided that the first point of Meṣa is to be taken 23° 15' ahead of the Vernal Equinoctial point, and all calculations should be made on that basis. 

36. Names of Solar Months. 

The names of the months should continue to be Caitra, Vaisakha, etc., as at present ; the appellation of solar or lunar should be attached to them as the case may be. 

The point regarding naming of the months of the National Civil Calendar was postponed for the next meeting. 

Monday, the 23rd February, 1953. 

The following attended : 

Prof. M. N. Saha (Chairman) Dr. K. L. Daftari 

(Member) Shri J. S. Karandikar Shri N. C. Lahiri Prof. R. V. Vaidya Shri K. G. Krishnamurthi 

Assistant Secretary, C.S.I.R. 

The Committee reviewed the items covered in the meeting held on Saturday. 

37. Tithi. 

The Chairman said that tithi calculations according to Indian method were wrong at present by sometimes as much as 6 hours and said that the Committee

2. Some members of the Committee suggested that additional members should be taken up on the Committee or co-opted. The Chairman said that, if necessary, additional members would be taken up or co-opted, but only at a later stage, after the proceedings are reported to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. 

3. Discussing the procedure to be followed, the Chairman said that the Committee should request the Government of India to appoint two astronomers to prepare the National Calendar on the lines suggested by the Committee and give them the necessary assistance. 

The Chairman is in correspondence with the Astronomer Royal of England regarding the compila tion of the Indian Ephemeris. 

4. The Chairman proposed to the Committee that Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya may be recommended to the Government to be appointed for the work of compilation of the National Calendar. : 

The Committee recommended that the services of Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya who were both Government servants be got on loan for a period of one year in the first. instance. The Committee also recommended that two assistants be appointed to assist Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya at Calcutta and Ujjain respectively. 

The Committee recommended that suitable budget provision be made for one year for the work.* 

* The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research had made budget grant for implementation of this recommendation and staff of calculators had been appointed. 

ANNEXURE II 

PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND MEETING 

The second meeting of the Calendar Reform Committee was held on the 8th March, 1954 at 10 A.M. in the C.S.I.R. Building, New Delhi. 

The following members were present :-- 

1. Prof. M. N. Saba, Chairman 2. Dr. Gorakh Prasad, Member 3. Shri J. S. Karandikar, 4. Prof. R. V. Vaidya, 

5. Shri N. C. Lahiri, 1. Prof. A. C. Banerji could not attend due to his other engagement which was appointed earlier. Dr. Daftari could not attend due to illness. 

2. Dr. Daftari sent a letter which was read by the Chairman. According to his 'suggestion it was decided that Yoga should be given in the Experimental Calendar, but Karana need not be given. Instead of 27 Yogas only Vyatipāta and Vaidhrti calculated with tropical longitudes of the Sun and the Moon should be given. 

3. The following further resolutions were adopted after discussion : 

(1) All festival days and days of religious obser vances in India should be shown and mention should be made of States in which they are observed, as has been done in the calendar. 

(2) The system of starting the year on the day following Vernal Equinox is confirmed. 

(3) Caitra should be the first month and the names of the months should be Caitra, Vaisakha, etc. Alternatively the civil months may be called Meṣa, Vrsabha etc., Meṣa being the name for solar Caitra. 

(4) The lengths of the months would be fixed as follows : 

Caitra 30 days (31 days in leap years), Vaisakha-31, Jyaiṣtha-31, Aṣādha-31, Srāvana-31, Bhädra-31, Aśvina-30, Kārtika-30, Agrahāyaṇa-30, Pauṣa-30, 

Māgha-30, and Phalguna-30 days. Leap-years should correspond with the leap-years of the Gregorian calendar. 

(5) Mahāviṣuva samkrānti is to be stated in the calendar on the vernal equinox day and the . Uttarayana samkrānti on the winter solstice day. Makara samkrānti should be on the day when the sidereal Makara is passed (ie, on 14th Jan. as at present). Vaiśākhi is to be celebrated on the first of 

Vaisakha. 

(6) Dates of heliacal rising and setting of Jupiter and Venus should be given in the calendar. 

(7) Sukla and Krṣna Pakṣas should be separately shown and tithis should be numbered from s 1 to 15 and K 1 to 14 and K 30. 

(8) Moment of rising of the centre of the apparent Sun to be given after making correction for refraction. The moment of sunset similarly calculated should also be given. 

(9) The moment of Sun's entry into the naksatra divisions should also be stated in the calendar. 

4. Dr. Gorakh Prasad enquired as to the amount of the precession of the equinoxes adopted in calcula ting the nakṣatras. He was informed that the calculations have been made with a constant ayanāmsa of 23° 15', as no definite directive was given in the 

16 

 

Reform Committee to complete the outstanding work, for which the C.S.I.R. may be moved by the Chairman. 

12. The suggestions received from different persons and institutions were read and discussed. 

previous meeting for changing the ayanāmsa year after year. He remarked that this is unscientific and opposed to the actual happenings in the sky. 

5. At this time the meeting was postponed for lunch till 3-0 PM when all the members present again met. 

6. Dr. Gorakh Prasad stressed upon the necessity of calculating the nakṣatras ( and also the sidereal Meṣādi etc. ) in such a manner that at the time of a particular nakṣatra, say Krttikā, the moon may be seen near the Krttikā group of stars in the sky. This practice is being followed since the Vedic times and is perfectly scientific and we cannot change this old systein. Shri Karandikar did not support this and stressed upon the necessity of adopting a constant ayanamśa. The Chairman remarked that constant ayanāmsa was opposed to science. Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya pointed out that if any change is intro duced in the ayanāmśa at this stage, the calendar for four years so far calculated will require a thorough revision involving a great amount of labour and time. It was, however, agreed that if the difference be small such as one or two minutes of arc, the labour involved in the revision would not be much, 

7. Dr. Gorakh Prasad pointed out that the Nakṣatras and the sidereal Meṣādi should be calculated from a fixed point which was 23° 15' in advance of the vernal equinoctial point on a certain date ( the middle of the period of 5 years for which the Pancanga was to be calculated %.e. on 21st March, 1956 ) and the rate at which this ayanāmsa is increasing on account of precession of the equinoxes should be taken into account. 

8. For the purpose of examining the above position thoroughly, the Chairman asked Prof. Vaidya to prepare a note on the Zero-point of the Hindu celestial globe according to the Surya Siddhānta and other older Indian Siddhāntas. This will be circulated and after taking opinion the point in paragraph 7 above will be decided by the Chairman. Pending finalization of this question, the calculations so far made should be regarded as provisional. 

9. The introduction to the report of the Calendar Reform Committee prepared by the Chairman was discussed and the general outline of the report approved. 

10. The activities of the C.S.I.R. on the recommen dation of the Calendar Reform Committee for publishing an Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac on behalf of the Government of India was explained to the members by the Chairman. 

11. It was resolved that an extension for six months should be given to the office of the Calendar 

Memorandum issued by the Chairman to the members 

of the Calendar Reform Committee 

on 22nd June, 1954. In the second meeting of the Calendar Reform Committee held at the C.S.I.R. Building, New Delhi on the 8th March, 1954, Dr. Gorakh Prasad raised the question of adopting variable ayanāmśā for the purpose of calculating nakṣatras as well as sidereal Meṣadi. After discussion it was, however, decided that Prof. Vaidya would prepare a note on the subject which would be circulated amongst the members, and after obtaining their opinion, the Chairman would decide the question. 

Dr. Gorakh Prasad thereafter submitted a note containing his definite proposals in this respect, which was also circulated amongst the members. He proposed that“ 23° 15' be taken as the Ayanāmsa on the vernal equinox day (21st March ) of 1956, because this will reconcile most of the Pancāngas in India based on modern constants." 

Prof. Vaidya prepared his note and it was circulated. Another note prepared in this office on the same subject was also circulated. It was explained in these notes that the Meṣādi of Surya Siddhānta was actually the V.E. point, and as the seasons and different solar and lunar months of the year are connected with Meṣādi, the year of the Indian religious calendar cannot but be the seasonal or tropical year. It has also been shown that it is not possible to arrive at any definite conclusion as to the actual amount of ayanansa at any epoch, from an examination of the star positions given by the Surya Siddhanta. 

Replies to the circular letters have been received from Dr. Daftari and Shri Karandikar, who desire that we should stick to the proposals adopted in the first meeting, viz., should adopt a constant ayanāmsa of 23° 15' for our religious calendar. I have consulted Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya also on this question. 

It appears to me that if we accept Dr. Gorakh Prasad's proposal of adopting a variable ayanāmsa for the calculation of nakṣatra as well as Mesadi, we shall lose the seasonal nature of the months which is against the Dharmaśāstra, as our Meṣādi being the V.E. point cannot be calculated with a variable ayanāinsa. We cannot therefore accept Dr. Gorakh 

 

17 

Prasad's second part of the proposal that the sidereal Meṣadi should also be calculated with variable ayanāmśa. It should therefore be calculated with a fixed ayanāmba of 23° 15' as already decided. 

As regards the calculation of nakṣatras, I agree that it should be done with a variable ayanāmsa, otherwise the nakṣatra divisions will lose all connec tions with the stars or star-groups contained in those nakṣatras. For this purpose I agree with Dr. Gorakh Prasad that the ayanāmsa of 23° 15' should relate to 21st March, 1956, the middle of the five-yearly period. 

This is acceptable without entering into any controversy about any particular value of ayanāmsa. 

The result would be that the Meṣādi would not coincide with any particular nakṣatra division for all time. This has got support of our śāstras behind it, as there is mention of such receding back of the V.E. point ( our Meṣādi ) over the nakṣatra divisions. 

The five yearly experimental calendar already prepared will be revised where necessary in the light of the above docision. 

ANNEXURE III

ANNEXURE IV A Summary of Reasons for the dissenting note by Dr. K. L. Daftari 

This manner of the calendar reform exactly fits in with the work on Dharmaśāstra. We have only to understand the words Caitra etc. and Aśvini etc. to be equivalent to Sāyana Caitra etc. and Sayana Aśvini etc. These, the people will find given in our calendar. Thus the present works on Dharmaśāstra even without any change will continue to serve our purpose for all time to come. Any other way of reforming the calendar will require the changes in the works on Dharmaśāstra themselves and we have no power to do the same because the people do suppose that we have no qualifications sufficient to change the Dharmaśāstras but we can suggest the new and the rational interpretation of the Dharmaśāstras as given above 

The real problem before us is to stop the moving back of the seasons through the months Caitra, Vaisakha etc., in such a manner that will fit in with the present Dharmaśāstra. We can only give a new interpretation or meaning to the words Caitra, Vaisākha etc., and Aśvini, Bharani etc., used in the Dharmaśāstras. From this stand point our resolutions in our first meeting still stand unimpeached. I shall now explain what I say. 

To stop the moving back of the seasons through the months Caitra etc. we must make the months move back with equal motion. That means that the months must correspond to or be pegged on the seasonal year and not on the sidereal year as at present. Therefore our resolutions to adopt the seasonal year for the pancānga is quite correct. All corollaries of this proposition must be correct and must be accepted. The corollary is that as at the time of Caitri Purnimā the moon will not be near the fixed star Citrā and similarly in Visakhā etc., the places where the moon will be under such circumstances must be given some other names and we should name them Sāyana Citra, Sāyana Viśākhā etc. We adopt these names being convinced that when the Dharmaśāstras name Castra, Vaiśākha etc., and Aśvini, Bharami etc., they really mean Sāyana Caitra, Sāyana Vaisakha etc, and Sayana Aścini, Sayana Bharani etc. The works on Dharma śāstras came into existence before the precession of equinoxes was discovered. The astronomical works written before Muñjāla, had no idea of the precession of equinoxes. At that time the writers on Dharma śāstra and astronomy thought that the seasonal year and the sidereal year were the same and as they had to regulate the religious functions according to the seasons they must have meant by Caitra, Vaisakha etc., the Sāyana Caitra, Sayana Vaiśākha and by Aśvini, Bharani etc., the Sāyana Aśvini, the Sayana Bharani etc. That the Dharmaśāstra and the Vedas regard only the seasonal year as the year, is clear from the statement in the Satapatha Brāhmana "44 Sht: Fagfaf 4[at: wala NGHI” (The seasons is the year. The year can stand only by the help of the seasons). In view of this statement it is clear that we will do real justice to the Dharmaśāstras if we understand by Caitra etc. the Sāyano: Caitra and by Aśvini etc. the Sayana Aśvini . etc. If we do not approve of the adjective Sāyana we may apply the adjective 'Cala' which is more expressive. We have to accept this interpretation of the Dharmaśāstras as the corollary of our proposition that we must accept the seasonal year for our calendar. 

Now I shall consider the objections raised by the Pañcānga Sodhana Pariṣad of Calcutta. The objections are stated in the following sentences. “Our religious festivals and observances were observed during all this period and no difficulty was experienced in any time. We are confident that in future also we shall experience no difficulty by this gradual shifting of the V. E. point. For this purpose if any attempt is made artificially to stop further receding back of the equinoxes, as appears to have been proposed by the Calendar Reform Committee, it will no doubt be completely opposed to our sastric tradition as well as to science". 

e V. E. Door to stop ve been 

in no doub 

This discloses complete ignorance of the history of our calendar system. In the beginning when our ancestors found that the V. E. had shifted back they changed the beginning of the year from one nakṣatra to another behind it, for example, they changed the beginning of the year from Myga to Rohini, from Rohini to Krttékā, from Krttikā to Dhaniṣthā, from Dhaniṣthā to Śravana and from Sravana again to Aśvini. These changes required corresponding changes in the Dharmaśāstras also. These were the times when the Dharmaśāstra had not become stationary as it has become at present. Our ancestors, therefore, could make necessary changes in Dharmaśāstra also. It was therefore that our ancestors, as the memorandum says, found no difficulty in observing the religious festivals. But now we actually find the difficulty because Dharmaśāstra has become stationary. Take the case of Vaiśākha Buddha Trtiyā or Akṣaya Trtiyā. In this festival we have to offer to a Brāhman an earthen pot for cooling drinking water. At present we get very hot summer on Akṣaya Trtiya and there fore the ceremony is the proper one at that time. In REPORT OF THE CALENDAR REFORM COMMITTEE 

19: 

future however, we shall have rainy season on Vaisakha Suddha Tyttyä after about 2000 years. Will this ceremony be proper at that time? We shall have to perform it at least on Caitra Suddha. Totīyā. This shows that if we stick to the sidereal year we shall then have to change the Dharmaśāstra from time to time. Are the objectors willing to accept such a position? They do not appear to be, because they are staunch followers of the Sastras and they want to follow them literally. The late S. B. Dixit has cited in his famous book some other examples like that of Akṣaya Trtiya (see pages 420 to 423), and in fact, we are very unwilling to perform our present functions in any season other than that in which we are at present performing them. The Sastras also as shown above really regard the round of the seasons as the year. It is because our śāstras regarded the seasons as equivalent to the year, and that our ancestors shifted several times, the beginning of the year from one nakṣatra to another, and they added intercalary months from time to time. Are we even now to follow this crude method of adjusting the year to the seasons or to adopt a more scientific method of gradually changing the beginning of the zodiac in conformity with the actual movements in the heaven? 

It is objected that the śāstras do not require all religious functions to be observed in the seasonal months. The objectors give example of Jonmāṣtami and say that we need not bother whether it is in rainy season or not. This is not true. We all suppose that the Lord Krṣna was born in rainy season and that he was taken from Mathura to Gokul through the flooded Yamuna. We would not like his birth day to be celebrated in the cold seasons. Though the Sastras require Rohini Nakṣatra on the birth day of the Lord Krṣna, we would rather accept his birth day in the rainy season with Sāyana or Cala Rohini on that day. Similarly about Vaiśākhi Purnima, Śrāvani Purnimā, Maghi Purnimā, Sarasvati Pūjā, mentioned in the memorandum, we do like to celebrate them in the seasons in which they are at present being celebrated and on days on which we shall have Sāyana or Cala Viśākhā, Sravana, Maghā, etc. nakṣatras. By adopting Sāyana or Cala nakṣatras, we will avoid the necessity of two systems, one sidereal and other tropical. suggested by the objectors and which will be too confusing to the public. The adoption of two systems will give rise to difficulties in Dharmaśāstra. It will give rise to questions about the system according to which particular ceremonies are to be performed, and different pandits will give different solutions to these questions. Thus there will be all confusion. On the contrary by adopting Sāyana or Cala nakṣatra for all ceremonies and Sayana months, we avoid all confusion and create certainty. 

The evidence in favour of seasonal months is so strong that the objectors make the following statement in favour of them. “In early Vedic times the sacrifices were performed in seasonal months. So all the Vedic festivals should no doubt be observed in the seasonal months.” But the objectors say, "But we do not agree that all other festivals which developed after the Vedic period, are required to be observed in the seasonal months." This objection cannot stand because there is no ground to suppose that the Dharmaśāstra with the object of making a change accepted the sidereal year in place of the seasonal year. 

It may be said that the names Caitra, Vaisakha etc. prove that the Dharmaśāstras accepted the sidereal year in place of the seasonal year. But this reasoning is refuted by the fact that they changed the beginning of the year from one nakṣatra to another to keep agreement with the seasons. Therefore the conclusion is that even the names Caitra, Vaiśākha etc. in Dharmaśāstra implied particular seasons. Here I will cite the authority of the famous work Dharmasindhu which plans to give decisions without citing authority. 

The work says, TATTW #TATUTATHATTI got of 771:1 Herre a faiforegrafia fetare : 1 amatet arrest 

सारणं प्रशस्तम्। 

Translation : Every two months from Caitra constitute lunar seasons beginning from Vasanta. However when there is intercalary month the lunar season consists of something less than 90 days. It is proper to mention the lunar season in all the ceremonies ordained by fa and afa. 

This means that whenever there is the word Caitra it implies the season Vasanta. This was no doubt the condition when the name Caitrādi first came into existence. But now Caitra comes in hot season (th). The late S. B. Dixit' also says : 

"चैववैशाख है वसंताचे मास हो परिभाषा सर्व पन्थात दिसून येते. ती स्थापित झाल्यावर पुष्कल कालामें ऋत्वारंभ मागें पाला, म्हणून काही ग्रन्थात मौन मेष है मास म्हणजे फाल्गुन-चैत्र में मास वसंताचे अशी परिभाषा पाली. व तीप्रमाणे कांहीं पञ्चांगात हल्ली ऋतु लिहितात. सांप्रत माघ-फाल्गुनांत वसंत होतो. तरी देखील चैत्र-वैशाख वसंत ऋतु ह्या परिभाषेचे प्रावल्य आहेच." 

Translation: The technical language that Caitra and Vaiśākha are the months of Vasanta is found in all works. Long time after it was established, the beginning of the seasons receded back. Therefore in some works we find the technical language that the Mina and Meṣa i.e. phālguna and Caitra are the months of Vasanta, and in some pañcāngas seasons are written according to that. At present Vasanta comes in the months of Magha and Phalguna. Even then the technical language that Caitra and Vaiśākha is Vasanta predominates, 

20 

 

All this shows that even when the names Castra, Vaiśākha etc. were used they meant a particular season also and that the season implied. has been changing. The resolutions of our Committee in our first meeting amount to this that Caitra and Vaiśākha hereafter shall always mean the Griṣma (hot season) etc. The memorandum of the objectors says that in the Dharmaśāstra seasons or seasonal months are not mentioned. To this my reply is as follows : 

In the Dharmaśāstra that enjoins the particular ceremony there may be no mention of seasons or Seasonal months. But the names of the months Caitra, Vaiśākha etc. are always there, and the names of the months implies particular season as shown above. Therefore the words Phalguna and Caitra in Dharma śāstra always imply the Vasanta season and Vaisakha always implies the hot seasons. This is the interpreta- . tion that we have to give to these names. By these names they always meant the particular seasons. We can give effect to the real meaning of these names only by supposing that Caitra means Sāyana Caitra, Vaiśākha means Sāyana Vaiśākha etc. 

I have already suggested above that it is confusing to accept the seasonal year for some ceremony and sidereal year for other. It is better to hold that even the words Caitra, Vaiśākha etc. imply the particular seasons and to take the seasonal year and seasonal months for all ceremonies. 

The memorandum raises objections on the grounds of the scientific terminology, Indian tradition and lexicography. This ground vanishes if we say that our names are really Sāyana Caitra, Sāyana Vaiśākha and Sāyana or Cala Aśvini, Sāyana or Cala Bharani, 

etc., and if we say that these names express the real meaning of Caitra, etc. and Aśvini etc. used in 

Dharmaśāstras. 

India is the country of blind orthodoxy. Whenever any improvement is proposed the people suppose that they will be drowned in the torrent of improvements, and they oppose the improvement blindly. Any person who wants to introduce the improvement has to be firm and should not give way to such resistance. Signatories of the memorandum are persons who would resist any improvement. Now they would resist the improvement in the calendar and if they become successful they would then resist the necessary improvements in the Dharmaśāstra also. We should not take account of such people and we should take care that we make no abrupt change that would disturb the passions of the people. It is therefore that we have resolved that we should accept 23° 15' ayanārśa instead of 0° ayanāinsa as proposed by some enthusiastic reformers. By this I refer to the memo randum submitted by Yeshwant Pradhan, Krishnaram Valgi Bhat and Dattatraya K. Sule who have proposed that we should take 0° as ayanāmsa. 

In conclusion I submit that we have rightly chosen in our first meeting not to make any changes in the works of Dharmaśāstra but to give them correct inter pretation and to make such changes in the calendar as will suit the calendar to that correct interpretation of the Dharmaśāstras. But unfortunately this decision has not been adhered to fully. Nirayana nakṣatras have been accepted for the calendar. This makes a change in the Dharmaśāstra necessary. Therefore now I suggest the alternative course suggested in my dissenting note.

II. For Religious Calendar : 

(i) Religious calendar of India should be luni-solar. (ii) Names of the months should be Caitra, Vaiśākha etc., the first month being Caitra.

Letter dated 3. 5. 54. 

(i) For all religious purposes tithi, nakṣatra, yoga and longitudes of the Sun and Moon should be calculated according to the old system and not according to the (modern) Alnianac system, for simple reason that our religion is based on the words of the ancient sages and pṣis. (ii) Nirayana calculation should be accepted. (iii) An observatory should be established. (iv) The advancement of science should be carried out giving due respect to śāstras. 

(viii) Indian standard time should be followed throughout. (ix) Heliacal rising and setting of planets should be given for every parallel of latitude commencing from 6° North and for the meridian of 821° East longitude of Greenwich.

Panjika, Calcutta, Shri Jatindra Nath Bhattacharya, editor, Jyotirbijnan, Calcutta, Shri Sudhibhusan Bhatta charya M.A., Calcutta, Pt. Dwaresh Chandra Sarmacharya M.A., Calcutta and the Secretary. 

(i) The latest astronomical elements should be adopted in the compilation of Indian pañcāògas. (ii) The calculation should be dřk-siddha. (iii) Tho Nakgatra cakra which is purely a sideroal system of astronomy and is being followed in India for at least the last 4000 years, should not be abandoned in the compilation of pañcāngas. (iv). The ayanāṁsa of the pro-siddhāntic period which was used in the Vedic period and in the glorious period of Hindu civiliza tion should be accepted. (v) The Citrāpaksa be adopted in the pañcāngas. (vi) According to Citrāpakṣa, 23° 15' ayanāmśa should be accepted for the year 1956. (vii) Rece ding back of the equinoxes should not be stopped artificially as it will no doubt be completely opposed to our śāstric traditions. (viii) Uttarāyana should start from the actual date i.e. Dec. 23 instead of Jan. 14 as it is now followed. (ix) The festivals which developed after the Vedic period are not necessary to be observed in the seasonal months. (x) The criterion of Aṣtami Robiņi in commemorating the birth day of Lord Kroņa should be followed, though it may go out of the rainy season, (xi) The tropical year which is being followed in certain religious festivals, should start from the V. E. point and not from 23° 15' ahead of the V. E. point. (xii) The sidereal names of the months cannot be used with the tropical year. For the tropical year, the names Madhu, Mādhava etc. or Prathama, Dvitiya etc. should be used. (xiii) The dates of the sidereal solar months should be standardized. (xiv) The sidereal year will have 12 months commencing from Vaiśākba, and general festivals should, however, be linked with the sidereal year.

Letter dated 14. 5. 54. 

(i) The.vernal equinoctial point should be the starting point of the year. The year should be tropical, consisting of 365.2422 days. (ii) The calendar should contain Tithi, Nakpatra, Yoga & Karana (if necessary) and exact time of the conjunction of the Moon with the 1st and 2nd magnitude stars. (iii) Against the idea of taking 23° 15' ayanāśa ahead of the V. E. point. (iv) Against the nirayana system for the following reasons : 

• (a) The authors of the different Siddhāntas could not 

fix the initial point for nirayana calculation. (b) Longitudes of some fixed stars as found in the 

Sūrya Siddhānta do not yield the location of the 

starting point. (c) At present the days and nights are not equal on 

the equinox days according to the present nirayana 

pañcāngas. (a) There is no · satisfactory proof in our sāstras 

that our religious festivals are based on nirayana 

system. (e) The zero year of the Hindu zodiac is different in 

different pañcāngas. 45. Shri Kashiram Sharma, Secretary, Jyotisha 

Sammelana (4th), Upper India, Ambala Cantt. 

Letter datod 7. 6. '54 intimating the recommendations of 

the conference 

(i) The new calendar to be prepared should be on Indign system and the important factors of the Pañcānga i.e.. lunar days and asterisms etc. should be computed purely according to Sūry& Siddhānta, so that there should be uniformity in the pañcāngas all over India and there should be no confusion in the observances of national festivals etc. (ii) The long. 82° 30' E. of Greenwich adopted as the standard meridian of India should be changed to 75o E. to be in conformity with ancient practices which will not in any way interfere with the universally accepted and prevalent zonal time covention. (iii) This conference demands from the Union Govt. that funds should be provided to start as many astronomical observatories as possible to promote the study of Jyotiṣa, during the next five years. In these observatories Indian astronomers well versed in Sanskrit and Hindu astronomy should be treated at par with modern astronomers. The central observatory should be situated at Ujjain or Kurukṣetra. (iv) To promote and encourage study of Jyotiṣa, it is desirable to start a Central Collego-cum Research Institute and a Central Library of Jyotiga. In this opllege arrangements should be made to teach Jyotiṣa with all its allied subjects on scientific lines.

(i) For civil purposes 22nd March may be adopted as the beginning of the year but for religious purposes year beginning should be followed according to the different conventions of the States. (ii) The recommendation for starting the calculation for religious purposes 23° 15' ahead of the V. E. point cannot be accepted, as the equinoxes are not fixed. (iii) Supports the recommendation for preparing a National Calendar for the whole of India and for establi shing a National Observatory with modern equipments. (iv) Disapproves the inclusion of tithis and nakṣatras in the National Calendar. (v) For religious purposes the duration of a tithi must not excood 65 dandas and must not fall short of 54 dandas. (vi) The calculation of tithis and nakṣatras should be done according to the Siddhāntas of India. (vii) To determine the months, dates and time for religious duties, calculation should be made from Surya Siddhānta on nirayana basis commencing from the fixed "First point of Aries" in the zodiac with fixed length of the solar year viz., 365.2587 days.

Forwarding resolutions adopted at the Brihan Maha rastra Jyotish Parishad conference, Jalgaon, held on 3rd, 4th & 5th July, 1954. 

(1) Disapproval :--The decision of the Calendar Reforma Committee of the Government of India, to fix 23° 15' as the fixed ayanāmsa is unscientific and would produce great confusion in future in religious matters, which are fixed in accordance with nakgatras and would produce irreligious ness and harm to religious practice and religious culture. The procession of equinoxes should be taken into account every year while determining the ending moments of nakṣatras and the luni-solar calendar be compiled accordingly. 

(2) Approval :- With respect to the other items proposed by the Committee e.g. Sālivāhana Saka and the Caitrādi beginning of tropical solar year etc. are acceptable.
