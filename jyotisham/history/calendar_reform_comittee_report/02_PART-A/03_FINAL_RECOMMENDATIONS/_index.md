+++

The calendar has got two distinct uses, viz., civil and religious. The Indian calendars, in the particular form it has assumed in different parts of the country, are used for the purpose of dating not only by the rural, but also by a large section of the urban population. On account of the fact, as mentioned above, that the usage of one area differs from another, the Committee recommends that the unified National Calendar should be used uniformly in all states of India, for civil purposes wherever necessary, in place of local calendars. 

## Vishvas's Comment
- The committee created a civil solar calendar (equinox to equinox), a religious solar calendar based on a fixed ayanAMsha +++(=deviation from equinoctial colure)+++ (23° 15') to prevent further drift from seasons, a religious lunar calendar closely tied to the religious solar calendar, a asterism tracking variable ayanAMsha (23° 15' 0", with annual correction) for the nakShatra wheel. The reason for standardizing religious calendars was to be able to determine office holidays.
- As far as religious calendars are concerned, the above standardization (barring the variable ayanAMsha for nakShatra divisions) was a compromise to prevent a violent break from current traditions. Basing the solar and lunar calendars on a fixed ayanAMsha prevents further drift of festivals from seasons, regardless of further drift of corresponding nakShatra-s.
- The variable ayanAMsha for nakShatra divisions has its pros (everlasting tie to corresponding asterisms) and cons (not being tropical).
