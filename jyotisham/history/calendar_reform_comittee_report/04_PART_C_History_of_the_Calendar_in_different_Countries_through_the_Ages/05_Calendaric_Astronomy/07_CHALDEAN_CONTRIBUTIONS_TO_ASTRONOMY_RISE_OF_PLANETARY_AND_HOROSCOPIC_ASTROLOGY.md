+++

We have seen that it was the needs of the calendar which gave rise to scientific astronomy which in the earliest times covered : 


The attention of mankind was drawn in remote antiquity to the five star-like bodies : Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn and Mercury. 

Venus and Jupiter and occasionally Mars are more brilliant than ordinary stars. Sooner or later, it was found that while the ordinary stars remain fixed on the revolving heavens these five stars creep along them, as a modern author puts it, 'like gloro-worms on a whirling globe', each in its own way. Venus appears as a morning and evening star, the maximum elongation being 47o. It early drew the attention of sea-faring people, its appearance on the eastern horizon indicating early sunrise to persons on lonely seas. But it took mankind some time to discover that it was the same luminary which appeared for some period as a morning star, then as an evening star. Its brilliance could not but strike the imagination of mankind. Mercury also appears regularly as morning and evening star, and it must have been discovered later than Venus, but still at such a remote age in antiquity that all traces of its discovery are lost. 

The motion of the brilliant luminary, Jupiter across the sky attracted early attention ; Mars

Although the planets always move in the same direction round the sun, their apparent motion among the fixed stars as seen from the earth, is not always in the same forward direction. They sometimes appear to move also in the backward direction among the stars, and this is known as the retrograde motion of a planet. The above figure reproduced from Pictorial Astronomy by Alter and Cleminshaw illustrates how Mars was seen to retrograde during June 24 to August 24.

an older form of Astrology widely found in Vedic India, which centred mainly round the moon, and the lunar wansions, and to a. lesser extent on the sun. The conjunction of the moon with certain nakṣatras was considered lucky, others unlucky (vide § 4:1). 

Planetary Astrology took the world by the storm after 300 B.C. and its influence was strongest during middle ages in Europe, till the rise of rationalism and modern science almost completely undermined this influence. But it still survives amongst the credulous in the West, but to a far greater extent than amongst the eastern nations. 

emerged in Babylonian history from the time of Assyrian supremacy (ca. 1300 B.C.), for these appeared to be linked up with the mysteries of Heaven itself, and the astrologer enjoyed very great prestige amongst the public, for did he not possess the mysterious power of foretelling correctly the dates of eclipses ! 

Here are some of the samples of astronomical omina during the last centuries of Assyrian power (900 B.C.-600 B.C.). 

"Mercury went back as far as the Pleiades"; "Jupiter enters Cancer" ; "Venus appears in the East" ; "Mars is very bright"; "Jupiter appears in the region of Orion";

By placiog the sun at the centre and having the earth and the other planets revolve in circles around it, Copernicus (1473-1543) was able to explain the backward motion of the planets among the stars much more simply than in the Ptolemaic system. This is illustrated in the above figure, taken from Pictorial Astronomy, in the case of Mars as seen from the earth. The earth's speed is 184 miles a second while that of Mars is only 15 miles & second. As the earth overtakes Mars, the latter seems to move backward. The direct motion of Mars to the east is shown at positions 1, 2 and 3, backward or retrograde motion to the 

West at 4 and 5, and direct motion to the east again at 6 and 7. 

What was the reason for the strong fascination which man has for astrology ? 

Mankind has always a psychological weakness for omina, i.e., some signs which can predict future events, good or bad. The older form of omina were rather crude, viz., flight of certain birds like the crow, or movements of animals like the jackal or the snake, howlings of certain birds and animals. In many countries, sheep and goats were sacrificed to gods on the eve of great enterprises, and Augurs claimed to be able to interpret the intentions of the gods from an examination of lines and convolutions on the liver of the sacrificial animal ( Hepatoscopy ). Meteorological phenomona such as a lightning discharge, haloes round the moon, aurora were also regarded as ‘omens'. 

The older forms of omina were all apparently very crude compared to planetary omina which gradually 

"Mars stands in Scorpio, turns and goes forth with diminished brilliancy"; "Saturn has appeared in the Lion" ; "Mars approached Jupiter"; and so on. 

There is not a trace of scientific interest in these texts ; the mind of the reporters is entirely occupied by the omens : When such or such happens, 

“it is lucky for the king, may lord”; or, "copious foods will come" ; "there will be devastation" ; "the crops will be diminished”; "the king will be besieged" ; "the enemy will be slain" ; 

there will be raging of lions and wolves" ; "the gods intend Akkad for happiness" ; 

and so on. 

Yet, with all those observations, these reports represent is considerable astronomical activity. For the first time in history a large number of data on the planets had been

collected ; it implies a detailed knowledge of facts about their motion."* 

The huge temples, called Ziggurats, ruins of which have been found in Mesopotamia, are supposed to have been dedicated to the planetary gods, each storey being assigned to a particular god. It was the duty of temple priests to keep the planets under observation, and record their positions on the only writing material available then viz., člay-tablets. Hundreds of thousands such clay tablets have been discovered in the ruins of Ziggurats, royal palaces and libraries, and patiently interpreted by western scholars like Kugler. .

In the large number of ancient horoscopes which have been studied by scholars, and in the astronomical tables compiled by ancient and medieval scholars, we have a huge amount of data on planets..

Regularities were not sought for ; but regularities imposed themselves, without giving surprise. They aroused certain expectations. Expectation is the first unconscious form of generalized knowledge, like all technical knowledge in daily life growing out of practical experience. Then gradually the expectation develops into prediction, an indication that the rule, the regularity, has entered consciousness. In the celestial phenomena the regularities appear as fixed periods, after which the same aspects return. Knowledge of the periods was the first form of astronomical theory».*

Dr. Thibaut in his Pañica Siddhāntikā could not explain the figures in col. (2). It can be verified that we can obtain the figures in col. (3) if we multiply the corresponding figures in col. (2) by 

365.2422 

360 The figures obtained by such multiplication are shown in col. (4), which are found to be very close to the fgures in col. (3). The figures in col. (2) can be explained in another way, viz., they are in degrees representing the arc through which the sun moves between two conjunctions. In other words, the figures in col. (2), not being ordinary mean solar days, are 'saura days' of Indian astronomy, a saura day being the time taken by the sun to move through one degree by mean motion, or 360 saura days = 365.2422 mean solar days. This explanation has been found by 

O. Neugebauer (vide his Exact Sciences in Antiquity). Most of these data were known to Hipparchos and also to Geminus, a Greek astronomer, who flourished about 70 B.C. 

The "astronomical science" as evolved by the Chaldean astronomers, is seen to be in reality the by 

The Greek papyri gives longitudes of the moon for dates 248 days apart. This period is based on the Babylonian relation : 9 anomalistic months=248 days. After eleven such steps of 248 days, there is a big step of 303 days in the. ephemeris. The length of the anomalistic month derived from these steps are as follows.

\- Two texts · called 'Mul Apin' dated round about . 700 B.C. have been discovered which contain summary of the astronomical knowledge of the time. Here is one of the pertinent passages from Neugebauer's Exact Sciences in Antiquity (p. 96). . 

"They are undoubtedly based on older material. They contain a summary of the astronomical knowledge of their time. The first tablet is mostly concerned with the fixed stars which are arranged in three “roads”, the middle one being an equatorial belt of about 30° width. The second tablet concerns the planets, the moon, the seasons, lengths of shadow, and related problems. These texts are incompletely published and even the published parts are full of difficulties in detail. So much, however, is clear : we find here a discussion of elementary astronomical concepts, still quite descriptive in character but on a purely rational basis. The data on risings and settings, though still in a rather schematic form, are our main basis for the identification of the Babylonian constellations." 

The passage indicates that the Chaldean astro nomers of this period could locate the north pole, and had come to an idea of the celestial equator, and could

Neugebauer and Sachs maintain that the ecliptic is first found mentioned in a Babylonian text of 419 B.C., but its use as a reference plane must have started much earlier, probably before 550 B.C. But the steps by which the knowledge of stars marking the ecliptic 

Probably the first stage was to determine the angular distance of heavenly bodies from some 'Normal Stars' as indicated by Sachs. These normal stars were stars either on the ecliptic, like Regulus, Spica, or a Librae or some other stars close to it. Sachs gives a list of 34 such normal stars. Probably the

was obtained, are not yet known with precision. Only some guesses can be made. 

The early astronomers probably observed that the bright stars Regulus (α Leonis ), Spica (α Virginis), the conspicuous group Pleiades, and certain fainter stars a Librae, a Scorpii were almost on the sun's path. The ecliptic could be roughly constructed by joining these stars. 

'Regulus' or α Leonis was the 'Royal Star' in Babylonian mythology. In Indian classics, it is known as Maghā (or the Great ) and the presiding deity is Indra, the most powerful Vedic god. It is almost exactly on the ecliptic. Citrā ( or α Virginis ) is 2° to : the south. 

The First Point of Aries :-The first point of Aries is the fiducial point from which all astronomical measurements are made. But how was this point, or any other cardinal point, say the first point of Cancer. ( summer solstice ), the first point of Capricornus. ( winter solstice ) and the first point of Libra, were located on the circle of the ecliptic in early, times ? 

For rarely have the first point of Aries nor any other of the cardinal points been occupied by prominent stars during historical times. Even if for measurement, the ancient astronomers used some kind of astrono mical instrument, say the armillary sphere, it would be difficult for them to locate the first point of Aries correct within a degree.

science, the use of astronomy for perfecting the calender appears in the West to have come to a stop after the Seleucidean era. For Rome conquered the whole western Asia up to the Euphrates by about 80 A. D., and the Julian calendar replaced the Babylonian luni-solar calendar, which have, however, .continued to currency probably in limited regions like Syria, Arabia and Iraq amongst certain communities. The Sassanid Persians also followed their own solar calendars inherited from Acheminid times. But the elements of the Chaldean luni-solar calendar have been used in a limited way, for the Christian ecclesiastic calendar for Christianity arose in Palestine and Syria, and the most important event in Christ's life, His crucifixion, is recorded in terms of the luni-solar calendar prevalent in Palestine about the first century A.D.
