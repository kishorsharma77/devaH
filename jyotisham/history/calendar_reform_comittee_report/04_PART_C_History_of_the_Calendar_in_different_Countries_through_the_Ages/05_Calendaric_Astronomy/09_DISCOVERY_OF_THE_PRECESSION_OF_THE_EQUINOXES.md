In the previous sections, we have stated how the Chaldean and Greek astronomers started giving

but is subject to variations which we may disregard at this stage. The shift is accumulative and in 100 years would amount to 1° 24', and in about 26000 years the first point will go completely round the ecliptic. The period depends upon certain factors and is not constant. 

The tropical year, or the year which decides the recurrence of seasons, is the time-interval for the return of the sun in its orbit, starting from the year's vernal equinoctial point to the next vernal equinoctial 

tropical year would be the same as the sidereal year, which is the same as the time of revolution of the earth in its orbit. But since the vernal equinoctial point slips to the west, the sun has to travel 360° 0' 01-50" =359° 59' 10" to arrive at the new vernal equi noctial point, hence the duration of the tropical year is less than that of the sidereal year by about 20 minutes. In exact terms : duration of the sidereal year = 365.25636 mean solar days 

, , tropical. = 365.24220 at the present time. 

Further Consequences of the Precession 

of the Equinoxes We may now consider some consequences of the 

positions of planets, and stars, with the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator—the first point of Aries-as the fiducial point. We shall now relate how the discovery was made that this point is not fixed in the heavens, but has a slow motion along the ecliptic to the west at the rate of ca. 50" per year. The rate is very small, but as it is unidirec tional and cumulative, it is of immense importance to astronomy, and incidentally is very damaging to astrology. 

When the sun, in course of its yearly journey arrives at the first point of Aries, we have the vernal equinox. The first point of Aries is therefore also called the vernal point. 

The position of the vernal point has rarely in the course of history, been occupied by a prominent star, but in India, as narrated in § 5:4, its nearness to star groups as well as the nearness 'of other cardinal points to star-groups have been noted from very early times. Traditions of different epochs record different stars as being near to the cardinal points. But nobody appeard to have drawn any conclusion from these records (vide for details § 5:4). 

In Babylon also, different sets of positions of stars and planets record Aries 15°, Aries 10°, and Aries 8° (the zero is of Ptolemy's) as being the vernal point. But no Chaldean astronomer to our knowledge appears to have drawn any conclusion from these data. 

The first astronomer known to have drawn attention to the precession of the equinoxes was Hipparchos. He particularly mentions that the distance of the bright star Spica (α Virginis or Citrā). has shifted by 2o from the autumnal equinoctial point since the time of his predecessor Timocharis who observed at Alexandria about 280 B.C. He concluded that the autumnal point, and therefore also the vernal point, was moving westward at the rate of 511 seconds per year. 

• It is not known whether Hipparchos considered the motion as unidirectional. It was impossible for him to say anything definite on this point, as obeservations extending over centuries are required to enable one to make a definite statement on this point. 

Though Hipparchos made, as time showed, one of the greatest astronomical discoveries of all times, which is all-important for the calendar, as well as for astronomy, its great importance does not appear to have been realized by either his contemporaries or followers for thousands of years. 

Let us, therefore, dwell a little on the consequences of this discovery.' Later and more accurate observa tions have shown that the rate is nearly 50° per year, 

Hipparchos appears first to have marked out the 

· beginning of the astronomical first point of Aries. It started go west of the star a Arietis. Ptolemy had found that it had shifted by his time by about 30, and gave the rate of precession as 36" per year. In this, he was wrong, the true shift being about 4'. Ptolemy in his 'Uranometry' gives the starting point of the sign of Aries as 6° to the west of ß Arietis, and the other constellations' marked at intervals of 30° may be marked out on the zodiac. The picture (Fig. 19) gives the boundaries of the different signs according to Hipparchos. The boundaries of the signs of Ptolemy would be 4o to the west of those of Hipparchos. 

By the time of Ptolemy, (and probably much earlier), a complex system of astrology had developed which connected men's destiny in life with the position of planets in the different signs at the time of his birth (horoscopy). It was claimed that even 

calculated in advance from planetary positions in the signs. Though a few rational men like Seneca and Cicero were as much sceptical about the claims of astrology as the modern man, the general mass became converted to its claims, even astronomers not excepted. Even the great Ptolemy wrote a treatise "The-Tetrabiblos' exposing the principles of Astrology. 

206 

·In fact, belief in astrology was one of the main incentives for the observation of the positions of heavenly bodies in ancient and medieval times which were carried out by medieval astronomers with so much zeal under the willing patronage of influential persons. 

The discovery of precession is very disconcerting to astrologers, for in the astrological lore, the signs are identified with certain fixed star-clusters ; whereas precession tends to take them entirely out of these star-clusters. Thus since Hipparchos's time, the shift has been nearly 30 degrees, and what was the sign of Pisces in Hipparchos's time has now become the sign of Aries, and the astronomical sign of Aries has now nothing to do with the Aries constellation, 

This consequence must have been foreseen by the followers of Ptolemy, and they probably started, more on psychological than on scientific grounds, to find out theories to mitigate the devastating influence of precession on astrology. Astronomers immediately following Ptolemy barely mentioned precession. It was first referred to by Theon of Alexandria (ca. 370 A.D.) who invented the theory of Trepidation, i.e., he said that the precessional motion was not unidirec tional, but oscillatory. He gave the amplitude of oscillation as 8o. Probably this figure was suggested 

\- Ptolemy's Almagest into Arabic ; he noted precession, 

but upheld the theory of trepidation. But the other great Arabic astronomers like al-Fargbani (861 Baghdad), al-Battāni (858-Syria), Abd al-Rabanān al-ṣafi (903-986-Teheran) and Ibn Yonus (d. 1009– Cairo), all noted precession and rejected the theory of trepidation. In fact al-Battani gave the rate of precession as 54" per year, which is far more correct than the rate given by Ptolemy, viz., 36" per year. 

But unfortunately, Europe recovering from the slumbers of dark ages were more influenced by the Spanish-Muslim astronomers al-Zarquali (1029-1087 of Cordova). and al-Bitruji (ca. 1150, living at Seville), who upheld. the theory of trepidation. As their influence was considerable, they were largely responsible for its diffusion among the Muslim, Jewish and Christian astronomers, so much so that Johann Werner (1522) and Copernicus himself (1543) were still accepting it ; Tycho Brahe and Kepler had doubts concerning the continuity and regularity of the precession, but they finally rejected the trepidation. The theory of trepidation was completely given up in Europe after 1687, when Newton gave a physical explanation of it from dynamics and the law of gravitation. This is given in appendix (4-A), for the benefit of Indian astrologers and almanac-makers who still believe in the theory of trepidation and oppose reform of the wrong calendar they are using for centuries. 

Sarton from whose writings much of this account has been compiled, writes* :: 

"The persistence of the false theory of trepidation is difficult to understand. At the very beginning of our era, the time span of the observations was still too small to measure the procession with precision and without ambiguity, but as the centuries passed there could not remain any ambiguity. Between the stellar observations registered in the Almagest and those that could be made by Copernicus, almost fifteen centuries had elapsed, and the difference of longitudes would amount to 210" 

Aries had shifted by a little less than 80 from Hipparchos's position, and Theon thought that it would go back and save astrology. 

Proclos the successor (410-485. A.D.), head of the Platonic Academy at Athens, a very learned man and one of the founders of Neoplatonism, denied the existence of precession! 

After the sixth century A.D, the dark age set in Europe and the mantle of scientific investigation fell on the Hindus and the Arabs. Let us see how the Arab astronomers regarded the precession.

About 2700 B. C., the second magnitude star a Draconis was the polo-star, as was, probably known to the ancient Egyptians, the Chinese and the Rg-Vedio

• The phenomenon of procession of the equinoxes tells us · where : that in addition to rotation, the earth has another motion, y=gravitational constant=6.67 X10-8 c. g. 8. units ; viz., a slow conical motion of its axis round the pole of O=moment of inertia of the earth round the polar axis ; the ecliptic which causes the equinoxes to move bakward. A=moment of inertia of the earth round an equatorial axis ; 

The phenomenon can be visualized by reference to the w=obliquity of the ecliptic=23° 26' 45" ; motion of tops played by boys (Fig. 23). 

m=mass of the sun=1.99 x 1088 gms ; It is a matter of common experience with those who

the top falls down ; the processional motion of the top is due to the pull exerted by the gravity. 

Now turning to the earth, we see that as a first approximation, wo may take it as a point of mass concentrated at the centre, and then deduce its orbit as is done in classical planetary theory. This would have been all right, if the earth wero a homogeneous sphere. But the earth is not & sphere, but a spheroid, having its polar axis shorter than the equatorial axis by 43 kms. (= 27 miles). There is an oquatorial bulge of matter. The pull due to the sun, is now equivalent to a force in the ecliptic passing through the centre of the earth defining the orbital motion, plus a couple, which tends to turn the equator of the earth into the plane of the ocliptic. It is this couple which produces precessional motion. 

For details of calculation the reader may refer to a book on Rigid Dynamics, say A. Webster, Dynamics, pp. 298-302. 

We mention only the results here : 

'If y be the angle of procession, i.e., the angle P, OP, in fig. 21. we have due to the sun's attraction 

\- 3ym jC-A 

cos w (t - sin. 21) 

we get the progressive part of the solar precession 

=246 10–18, 

This is in radians per second of time. To convert it to seconds of arc per year, we have to multiply the expression by 2.063 x 108 x 3.156 X 10". 

2.063 X 10% being the number of seconds of angle in a radian, and 3.156 x 107 the number of seconds of 

time in the year. We have therefore the rate of solar precession 

=16."0 por year. We have now to calculate the action of the moon which, in spite of its much smaller mass, exerts & far larger perturbing force as the lunar distance is much smaller. In fact the tide raising force (mm) for the moon is more than double that of the sun. This makes the rate of lunar precession=34".4 per year. 

But there is another complication. The moon's orbit is not coincident with he sun's path (ecliptic) but is inclined at an average angle of 5° 9', the extreme values being 5° 19' and 4° 59'. Further the points of intersection of the moon's orbit with the ecliptic travel round the ecliptic in a period of 18.6 years. The pole of the moon's orbit M therefore moves round the pole of the ecliptic C as shown in fig. 24 in a period of 18.6 years. The lunar precessional angle Won has therefore to be defined from the instantaneous position of M. 

Combination of the two precessional motions. 

The two precessions can be combined as in fig. 24. Hero C, M are the polés of the ecliptic and of the moon's orbit: P is the celestial pole. The solar procession can bio

the ecliptic, which would otherwise have been uniform. These periodic (period=18'6 years) variations are known as Nutation. 

\------F....---R 

Annual Rate of Precessional Motion 

The solar and lunar processions amount to 50.937 per tropical year, with a very small centurial variation. After making necessary corrections for the slight motion of the plane of the ecliptic due to attraction of planets, the annual rate of general procession in longitude is obtained as follows : 

Rate of procession=50."2564+0."0222 T per trop. year, where T=Tropical centuries after 1900 A.D. 

The putation in longitudo may amount to +17.''2 according to different positions of the lunar node, but its effect on the annual rate of precession does not exceed £5."8, so that the actual precession rate per year may vary between 44."5 to 56."0. 

The average rate of annual precession is not constant, it is very slowly increasing. The annual rate for certain epochs along with the period taken by the equinoxes to move through 1°, are however stated below :
