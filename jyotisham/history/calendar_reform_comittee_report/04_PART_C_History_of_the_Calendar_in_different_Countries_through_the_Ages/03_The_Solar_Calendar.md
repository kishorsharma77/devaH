## ANCIENT EGYPT 

### Lunar calendar
Like other nations of antiquity the early Egyptians had a year of **360 days divided into 12 months, each of 30 days**; but they found very early from the recurrence of the Nile flood, that the seasonal year consisted approximately of 365 days, and that a month or lunation (period from one new-moon to another) was nearly 29.4 days (real length 29.531 days). But they had already framed a calendar on the 30-day month, and 360-day year, which had received religious sanction. Hence arose the first necessity for calendar reform recorded in ancient history. To persuade the people to agree to this reform their priests invented the following myth : 

"The **Earth god Seb** and the **sky goddess Nut** had once illicit union. The supreme god **Ra**, the Sun, thereupon cursed the sky goddess Nut that the children of the union would be born neither in any year nor in any month. Nut turned to the **god of wisdom, Thoth**, for counsel. Thoth played & game of dice with the **Moon-goddess**, and won from her 1/72th part of of her light out of which he made five extra days. To appease Ra the Sun-god, these five days were given to him, and his year gained by five days while the Moon-goddess's year lost five days. The extra five days in the solar year were not attached to any month, which continued to have 30 days as before ; but these days came at the end of the year, and were celebrated as the birthdays of the gods born of the union of Seb and Nut, viz., **Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Set and Anubis**, five chief gods of the Egyptian pantheon.” - * Zinner-Geschichte der Sternkunde, p. 3.

### Initial solar calendar
Let us scrutinize the implications of this myth. This is tantamount to discarding the moon altogether as a time-maker, and basing the calendar entirely on the sun. This was a very wise step, for as has been found from ancient times, the moon is a very inconvenient time marker. The Egyptians maintained the old custom of keeping months of 30 days' duration, and 12 months made a year. But **five days (Epagomenai in Greek) were added to the year at the end**, which were not attached to any month. They were celebrated as national holidays. **Each month** of the Egyptian calendar was divided into **3 weeks, each of 10 days (Decads)**.' 

The names of the Egyptian months together with the dates of beginning of each month as they stood in 22 B.C., are as follows : 

- Egyptian Calendar Julian Calendar 
- 1 Thoth (30) 29 August 
- 1 Phaophi (30) 28 September 
- 1 Athyr (30) 28 October 
- 1 Choiak (30) 27 November 
- 1 Tybi 27 December 
- 1 Mechir (30) 26 January 
- 1 Phamenoth (30) 25 February 
- 1 Pharmuthi (30) 27 March 
- 1 Pachon (30) 26 April 
- 1 Payni (30) 26 May 
- 1 Epiphi (30) 25 June 
- 1 Mesori (30) 25 July 
- (1 Epagomenai 5) 24 August 

The year was divided into three seasons, each of four months : Flood time, Seed time and Harvest time. 

But the Egyptians soon found that even a year of 365 days did not represent the correct length of the year, which, as we now know, is nearly 3651 days. This fact they appear to have discovered in two different ways: 

- from their measurement of the length of the year from **heliacal risings of Sirius**, and 
- from their **long record of floods** extending over centuries. 

The fixed star **Sirius**, which is the most brilliant star in the heavens, was early associated with the chief goddess of the Egyptian pantheon, **Isis**, and was the subject of observation by her priests. The day of its first appearance on the **eastern horizon** at day-break (heliacal rising) appeared to have been carefully observed, and then on every subsequent day, its position in the sky at sunrise used to be noted. It was found that gradually it got ahead of the sun, so its appearance on the horizon would be observed sometime before sunrise, and on every successive sunrise, it would be found higher up in the heaven. After about a year it would be seen in the western horizon at sunset for a few days till it could no longer be traced. The Egyptians found as a result of long periods of observation, that it came again to the horizon at day break at the end of 365.25 days, not 365 days. If on one year, the heliacal rising of Sirius took place on **Thoth 1**, (Thoth was the name of the first month of the year) four years later it would take place on **Thoth 2**, and forty years later on **Thoth 11**. As the mean interval of heliacal rising of Sirius at the latitude of Memphis was 365.25 days, the Egyptians concluded that the heliacal rising of Sirius would continue to move round the year in a complete cycle of ca. 1460+++(=365*4)+++ years ; called the **Sothic cycle**, after Sothis (Isis) +++(before it coicides with Thoth 1)+++. They also appear to have found from observations over long periods of years that the Nile flood occurred not at intervals of 365 days, but of 365.25 days. 

On account of the deficiency of 1/4 day in the year, the year-beginning lost touch with the arrival of the Nile flood, though the temple **priests** had devised a method of finding out the interval between Thoth 1, and **arrival of the Nile flood by observations of the heliacal rising of the bright star Sirius**, identified with their chief goddess Isis. But they kept the knowledge to themselves. 

If the Egyptians carried out a reform of their calendar incorporating this fact, that the tropical year had a length of 365.25 days, their calendar could have been almost perfect. All that they had to do was to take 6 extra days instead of 5 every fourth year. But the 365 day year had so much soaked into the Egyptian mind, that this move for calendar reform was never adopted inspite of **serious attempts by earlier Pharoahs**, and later, a more serious one by **the Graeco-Egyptian ruler Ptolemy Euergetes** ( 238 B.C.). But it became generally known that the correct length of the year was 365.25 days.

Fotheringham in his article on "The Calendar" observes : 

An **additional day** was inserted at the close of the Egyptian year 23-22 B.C. on August 29 of what we call the Julian calendar, and **at the close of every fourth year** after wards, so that the **reformed or Alexandrian year**, began on August 30 of the Julian calendar in the year preceding à Julian leap year and on August 29 in all other years. The effect of this reform was to keep each Egyptian month fixed to the place in the natural year which it happened to occupy under the old calendar in the years 26-22 B.C. But the old calendar was not easily suppressed, and we find the **two used side by side till A.D. 238 at least**. The **old calendar** was probably the **more popular**, and was preferred by astronomers and astrologers. Ptolemy (150 A.D.) always used it, except in his treatise on annual phenomena, for which the new calendar was obviously more convenient. Theon in the fourth century A.D., though mentioning the old calendar, habitually used the new. 

Though not quite perfect, the Egyptian calendar was greatly admired in antiquity on account of its simplicity, for the length of the year and the months were fixed by definite rules and not by officials or pandits. The **religious observances** fell on **fixed days of the month** and at stated hours, which were **fixed about 1200 B.C**. 

On account of its simplicity, the Egyptian calendar was adopted by many nations of antiquity, and even sometimes by the learned Chaldeans and Greeks, Fotheringham observes : 

"The Egyptian calendar was, upto the time of Julius Caesar's reform of the Roman calendar in 46 B.C., **the only civil calendar** in which the length of each month and of each year was fixed by rule instead of being determined by the discretion of officials or by direct observation. If the number of years between two astronomical observations, dated by the Egyptian calendar, was known, the exact number of days could be determined by a **simple calculation**. No such comparison could be made between dates referred to any other civil calendar unless the computer had access to a record showing the number of days that had actually been assigned to each month and the number of months that had actually been assigned to each year. It is true that the Egyptians **did not use a continuous era**, but were content to number the years of each reign separately, so that there was a difficulty in identifying a particular year, but the astronomers of the Ptolemaic age rectified this by the **introduction of eras**. +++( The Nabonassar Era-vide $ 3.4.)+++ The simplicity and regularity of the Egyptian calendar commended it to astronomers, who found it excellently adapted to the construction of tables that could be readily applied and used even for a remote past or for a distant future without any fear that the system by which time was reckoned in the tables might not coincide with the system in actual use. In the second century B.C. we find **Chaldean observations**, sometimes nearly **six centuries old**, **reduced to the Egyptian calendar in the works of Hipparchus** (126 B.C.), who **observed not in Egypt but at Rhodes**, and cited from him by the Egyptian Ptolemy in the second century of our era ; we also find in the second century B.C., **an Athenian observation of 432 B.C. reduced to the Egyptian calendar on an inscription found at Miletus**, which appears to represent the work of the astronomer Epigenes". +++( Article on "The Calendar', Nautical Almanac, 1935.)+++

This calendar survives in a slightly modified form in the Armenian calendar, the three first months of the old Egyptian year corresponding exactly with the three last months of the Armenian year. The Alexandrian calendar is still the calendar of Abyssinia and of the Coptic Church, and is used for agricultural purposes in Egypt and other parts of northern Africa. 

## OTHER ANCIENT NATIONS 

The story of the calendar in Egypt has been given in full, because the ancient Egyptians evolved a very simple and convenient calendar which, as mentioned before, would have been almost perfect (provided the year was taken to consist of 365 1/4 days instead of 365 days). This was rendered possible by their bold initiative of discarding the moon as a time-marker. But people in the remaining parts of the civilized world (e.g., in Babylon, Greece, India and China) in ancient and moderm times, retained the moon and preferred the more complex luni-solar calendars described in Chap. III. This was rather fortunate, for if their rulers had adopted the Egyptian calendar, the **priest astronomers of ancient nations**, particularly of Babylon, **would never have taken to observation of the sun, the moon, and the planets, and tried to evolve mathematical formulae for predicting** their positions amongst stars in advance (the Ephemerides), which form the basis on which our astronomical knowledge has been built up; for the Egyptian calendar was evolved simply from results of experiences extending over centuries, and required almost no astronomical sense, or observations either of the sun, the moon and stars, except the heliacal rising of Sirius. It was simple and convenient, but like many perfect things, it killed intellectual curiosity. 

But as will be described in Chap. III, the luni-solar calendar is a very complex thing, and has taken infinite variations in different regions. Hence the simple Egyptian calendar appealed to many nations of antiquity as well as of modern times. We have related the case of the Greek astronomers Hipparchos and Ptolemy who preferred the Egyptian method of date-recording to the Greek methods. This was, however, not the solitary instance. 


## THE IRANIAN CALENDAR 

The great Iranian conqueror Darius (520 B. C.), whose empire comprised Egypt, Mesopotamia, Syria and Asia Minor, besides his native country of Iran, certainly came into contact with the diverse calendars of older civilizations, but he appears to have **preferred the Egyptian calendar** to the more complex Babylonian calendar, and introduced it in his vast empire. 

But the astronomers of Darius made correction of the deficit of 1 day of the year in another way. They had all years of 365 days, but used an **interaclary month of 30 days in a cycle of 120 years**. 

All the names of the **old Iranian months** and details of their calendar are not available now. The month-names as far as could be traced are stated below: 


- Thuravahara 
- Thaigraci 
- Adukani 
- ...
- Garmapada 
- ... 
- Bāgayadi 
- ... 
- Atriyadija 
- Anāmaka 
- Margazana 
- Viyachna

After the Islamic conquest of Persia in 648 A.D., the purely lunar calendar of Islam (Hejira) was imposed on Persia, but it does not appear to have been liked by the native Iranians. 

In 1074-75 the Seljuq Sultan Jelal Uddin Melik Shah called upon the celebrated **Omar Khayyam** and seven others to reform the old Persian calendar. The calendar as reformed by them was called **Tarikh i-Jelali**, its era was the 10th Ramadan of Hejira 471 – 16th March, 1079 A.D. There are **many interpretations** of the Jelali reform, the modern interpretation being 8 intercalary days in 33 years, giving the length of the year as **365.24242 days**. The year started from the day of or next to vernal equinox. 

The Parsees in India, the followers of the Prophet Zarathustra are the descendants of Iranians who took shelter in India on the conquest of Persia by the Arabs. The following details about their calendar is reproduced from Encyclopaedia Britannica (14th edition), Parsees : 

The Parsees of India are divided into two sects, the **Shahanshahis** and the **Kadmis**. They differ as to the correct chronological date for the computation of the era of **Yazdegerd**, the last king of Sassanian dynasty, who was **dethroned by the caliph Omar** about A.D. 640: This led to the variation of a month in the celebration of the festivals. The Parsees compute time from the fall of Yazdegerd. Their calendar is divided into **twelve months of thirty days** each ; the other five days, being added for holy days, are not counted. Each day is named after some particular angel of bliss, under whose special protection it is passed. On feast days a division of five watches is made under the protection of five different divinities. In midwinter a feast of six days is held in commemoration of the six periods of creation. About March 21, the vernal equinox, a festival is held in honour of agriculture, when planting begins. In the middle of April a feast is held to celebrate the creation of trees, shrubs and flowers. On the fourth day of the sixth month & feast is held in honour of Sahrevar, the deity presiding over mountains and mines. On the sixteenth day of the seventh month a feast is held in honour of **Mithra**, the deity presiding over and **directing the course of the sun, and also a festival to celebrate truth and friendship**. On the tenth day of the eighth month a festival is held in honour of Farvardin, the deity who presides over the departed souls of men. This day is especially set apart for the performance of ceremonies for the dead. The people attend on the hills where the "towers of silence" are situated, and in the sagris pray for the departed souls. The Parsee scriptures require the last ten days of the year to be spent in doing deeds of charity. 


In modern Iran when Riza Shah Pahlavi came to power in 1920, he instituted a reform of the existing Muslim calendar abandoning the strictly lunar reckoning and introducing purely solar year restoring the early Persian names which had never fallen entirely out of use. 



The names of the months, and their lengths are as follows: 

- Farvardin-mah (31) begins 21 or 22 March 
- Ardibahisht-mah (31) , 21 or 22 April 
- Khordad-mah (31) , 22 or 23 May 
- Tir-mah (31)  22 or 23 June 
- Mordan-mah (31) begins 23 or 24 July

- Aban-mah (30) 23 or 24 October 
- Azar-mah (30) 22 or 23 November
- Dai-mah (30) 22 or 23 December
- Bahman-mah (30) 21 or 22 January
- Esfand-mah (29, 30) 20 or 21 February 


## THE FRENCH REVOLUTION CALENDAR 

The Egyptian calendar attracted the notice of the calendar committee of the French Revolutionary Government (1789-1795) who wanted to **replace Religion by Reason**. The committee consisted, amongst others, the great mathematicians **Laplace and Lagrange** and the poet d'Eglantine. Laplace proposed that the year 1250 A.D., when according to his calculations the equinoctial line was perpendicular to the apse line +++(=major axis)+++ of the Earth's orbit should be taken the starting point of the French Revolution Era in place of a hypothetical year of Christ's birth. But the calendar committee did not agree with him but started the era of the glorious French revolution, with the autumnal equinox day of 1792 A.D., as this was nearest in date to the outbreak of the revolution. Sentiment proved stronger than cold scientific reasoning.

The seven-day week was abandoned for a week of 10 days. The month names were invented by the poet member of the committe. The last five days were dedicated to the service of the poor ( Sans-Culottides ) and did not form part of any month. 

After 13 years of service, the French Revolution calendar was abolished by Napoleon Bonaparte, then emperor of France, as part of his bargain with the Roman Catholic Church for his coronation by the Pope. 

## THE ROMAN CALELNDAR 
(The Christian Calendar) What is now known as the Christian calendar, and used all over the world for civil purposes, had originally nothing to do with Christianity. It was, according to one view, originally the calendar of semi-savage tribes of Northern Europe, who started their year sometime before the **beginning of Spring (March 1 to 25) and had only ten months of 304 days ending about the time of winter solstice (December 25)**, the remaining **61 days** forming a period of **hybernation** when no work could be done due to the onset of winter, and were not counted at all. The city state of Rome also had originally this calendar, but **several corrections** were made by the Roman Governments at different epochs and the final shape was given to it by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C.; the calendar so revised is known as the Julian calendar. 

As already stated, this calendar originally had contained ten months from March to December comprising 304 days. It may be regarded as certain that the months were lunar. The second Roman king of the legendary period, Numa Pompilius, is supposed to have **added two months (51 days)** to the year in about 673 B.C., making a total of 355 days ; **January (named from the god Janus, who faced both ways)** now began the year, and February preceded March, which became the third month. The number of days of the months were 29, 28, 31, 29, 31, 29, 31, 29, 29, 31, 29, 29. Adjustment of the year to the proper seasons was obtained by **intercalation of a thirteenth month of actually 22 or 23 days** length (called Mercedonius) after two years or three years as was considered necessary, and was inserted between February and March.* Had the intercalation been applied regularly at alternate years the additional days in four years would have been 45 (22+23) or 11.25 days per year on average, and so the year-length would have been **366.25** days, only one day in excess of the correct length. But as the intercalation was applied rather arbitrarily some times after two years and sometimes after three years, the **year-beginning gradually shifted** and the year started before the arrival of the proper seasons. 

The days of the month in the Roman calendar were **enumerated backwards from the next following Kalends** (1st of month), **Nones** (5th of month, except in the 31-day months, when the 7th of month), or **Ides** (13th of month, except in the 31-day months, when the 15th of month). The day after the Ides of March, for instance, would be expressed as 17 days before the Kalends of April. 

The Romans upto 45 B.C. apparently had rather a vague idea of the correct length of the year. Julius Caesar after his conquest of Egypt in 44 B. C. introduced the **leap-year system** on the advice of **Egyptian astronomer Sosigenes**, who suggested that the mean length of the year should be fixed at 365.25 days, by making the normal length of the year 365 days and inserting an additional day every fourth year. At the same time the lengths of the months were fixed at their present durations. The extra day in leap years was obtained by repeating the sixth day before the Kalends of March. The name Quintilis, the 5th month from March, was changed to **July** (Julius) in 44 B.C. in honour of Julius Caesar, and the name Sextilis was changed to **August** in 8 B.C. during the reign of his successor, Augustus, and in honour of him. There is a very widespread idea that the durations of July and August were fixed at 31 days. each in order to please the two Roman dictators Julius Caesar, and Octavious Caesar, also called Augustus, and for this purpose the two extra days were cut off from February, thus reducing its duration to 28 days. It is a nice story, but does not appear to have been critically probed. 

Owing to the drifting of the year-beginning, the year 46 B.C. started about 90 days before the proper seasons. The months were first brought back to their correct seasons by giving the year corresponding to **46 B.C.**, a normal intercalation of 23 days after February and then inserting 67 additional days between November and December. This year therefore contained 445 days in all and is known as the '**year of confusion**'. 

(\* In fact, the intercalary month consisted sometimes of 27 days and sometimes of 28 days and was inserted after February 23. The last five days of February, which were due to be repeated after the close of the intercalary month, were not actually repeated, resulting in the intercalation of 22 or 23 days only. )

But the perfect calendar was still a long way off. Caesar wanted to start the new year on the 25th December, the winter solstice day. But people resisted that choice because a new-moon was due on January 1, 45 B.C. and some people considered that the new-moon was lucky. Caesar had to go along with them in their desire to start the new reckoning on a traditional lunar landmark. 

The Julian calendar spread throughout the Roman empire and survived the introduction of Christianity. But the Christians introduced their own holidays which were partly Jewish in origin and for this, luni solar and week-day reckonings had to be adopted.

### Origin of the Seven-day Week 

Invention of the Seven-day Week Much of ancient astronomical knowledge is due to Chaldean astronomers who flourished between the seventh century B.C. and the third century A.D., as related in $4.7. They gave particular attention to the study of the movement of the sun, the moon and the planets, which they identified with their gods, because they thought that destiny of kings and states were controlled by the gods, i.e., by the planets, and attached the greatest importance to the observa tion of the position and movement of planets. They attached magical value to the number 'Seven' which was the number of planets or gods controlling human destiny. 



: Historical scholarship has shown that unlike the year and the month, the seven-day week is an artificial man-made cycle. The need for having this short cycle arose out of the psychological need of mankind for having a day of rest and religious service after protracted labour extending over days. The seven-day week with a sabbatical day at the end, or something similar to it, is needed not only by God Almighty, but also by humbler toiling men. But there has been no unanimity of practice. 



In 'Planetary Astrology', the sun, the moon and the five planets, were identified with the chief gods of the Babylonian pantheon as given below : 



Planets Babylonian 



God-names Their function (1) Saturn....Ninib ... God of Pestilence and 



Misery. (2) Jupiter Marduk... King of Gods. (3) Mars.......Nergal... God of War. (4) Sun.........Shamash... God of Law & Order or 



Justice. (5) Venus...... Ishtar....... Goddess of Fertility. (6) Mercury...Nabu......... - God of Writing. (7) Moon....... Sin........... God of Agriculture. 



As already stated, the ancient Egyptians had a ten day week. The Vedic Indians had a six-day week The ancient Babylonians who started the month on the day after new-moon, had the first, eighth, fifteenth, ånd the twenty-second day marked out for religious services. This was a kind of seven-day week with sabbaths, but the last week might be of eight or nine days' duration, according as the month which was lunar had a length of 29 or 30 days. The ancient Iranians had a separate name for each day of the month, but some days, at intervals of approximately seven, were marked out as Din-i-Parvan, for religious practices. The pattern followed appears to have been similar to the Babylonian practice. The continuous seven-day week came into general use sometime after the first century A.D. It was unknown to the writers of the New Testament who do not mention anything about the week day on which Christ was crucified or . the week day on which he is alleged to have ascended to Heaven. The fixing of Friday and Sunday for these incidents is a later concoction, dating from the fifth century after Christ. All that the New Testament books say is that He was crucified on the day before the Hebrew festival of Passover which used to be celebrated and is still celebrated on the full-moon day of the month of Nisan. 



These seven gods, sitting in solemn conclave, were supposed to control the destinies of kings and countries, and it was believed that their will and judgement with respect to a particular country or its ruler could be obtained from an interpretation of the position of the seven planets in the heavens, and the nature of motion of the planets (direct or retrograde). 



The Chaldean god-names are given in the second column, and the functions they control in the third column. Their identification with the Roman gods is given in the first column. The planets* were put in the order of their supposed distances from the earth. 



The continuous seven-day week was evolved on astrological grounds by unnamed astronomers who may have been Chaldean or Greek at an unknown epoch, but before the first century A.D. The Jews adopted it as a cardinal part of their faith during days of their contact with the Chaldeans. It is not their invention. We give a short story of this invention, as it is generally believed. But it may not be quite accurate in all details. 



Further, the day was divided into 24 hours, and each of the seven gods was supposed to keep watch on the world over each hour of the day in rotation. The particular day was named after the god who kept watch at the first hour. Thus on Saturday, the watching god on the first hour was Saturn, and the day was named after him. The succeeding 



*Planets used not in modern sense but in the old sense of a wander ing heavenly body. 



170 



hours of Saturday were watched by the seven gods in rotation as follows : 



the classics like the great epic Mahabharata. They occur in inscriptions only from 484 A.D., but not in inscriptions of 300 A.D. Even now, they form but an únimportant part in the religious observances of the Hindus which are determined by the moon's phases. . 



It can therefore be said that the unbroken seven day week was not a part of the religious life of any ancient nation, and it is not, even now, part of the religious life of many modern nations. It is a man-made institution introduced on psychological grounds, and therefore can be or should be modified if that leads to improvement and simplification of human life. 



Saturday. Hours 



1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8...14 15 22 23 24 25 God Watching 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1... 7 1 1 2 3 4 (Sun) 



The table shows the picture for Saturday. On this day, Saturn keeps watch at the first hour, so the day is named after him. The second hour is watched over by (2) Jupiter, third bý (3) Mars and so on. Saturn is thus seen to preside at the 8th, 15th and 22nd hours of Saturday. Then for the 23rd, 24th and 25th hours come in succession (2) Jupiter, (3) Mars and (4) Sun. The 25th hour is the first hour of the next day, which was accordingly named after the presiding planet of the hour, viz., No. 4 which is Sun. We thus get Sunday following Saturday. If we now repeat the process, we get the names of the week days following each other, as follows : 



Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday... 



The Christian Era 



The present Christian era came into vogue much later. About 530 A.D., the era-beginning was fixed from the birth year of Christ which was fixed after a certain amount of research by the Scythian Bishop Dionysius Exiguus and Christ's birth day (Christmas) was fixed on December 25 which was the Julian date for the winter solstice day and the ceremonial birth day of the Persian god Mithra in the first century B.C. The discovery of a Roman inscription at Ankara shows that King Herod of the Bible who is said to have ordered the massacre of innocents was dead for four years at 1 A.D., and therefore Christ must have been born on 4 B.Ç., or somewhat earlier.

The Julian year of 365,25 days was longer than the true year of 365.2422 by .0078 days, so the winter solstice day which fell on December 21 in 323 A.D., fell back by 10 days in 1582 A.D. and the Christmas day appeared to be losing all connections with the winter solstice. Similar discrepancy was also noticed in connection with the observance of the Easter.* Various proposals were made for correcting the error and the Council of Trent which assembled in 1545 authorised 'the Pope to deal with the matter. When in 1572, Gregory XIII became Pope, these schemes were considered and the plan that was most

The Jews, it may be mentioned, reckon the days by ordinal numbers--the first, second......... seventh day. The first day is Saturday. 



The seven-day week, from the account of its origin is clearly based on astrological ideology. The conti nuous seven-day week was unknown to the classical Greeks, the Romans, the Hindus, and early Christians. It was introduced into the Christian world by an edict of the Roman emperor Constantine, about 323 A.D., who changed the Sabbath to the Lord's Day (Sunday), the week-day next to the Jewish Sabbath. Its introduction into India is about the same time and from the same sources. The week-days are not found in earlier Hindu scriptures like the Vedas or

tion of Jesus Christ, on the first Sunday after the full-moon following the vernal equinox day. The last days of Christ coincided with the Passover fast of the Jews and his death fell upon the day of the feast of the Passover, on the 14th day of the month of Nisan. As the date of Easter is associated with the moon's phases, as well as the vernal equinox day, it is a movable festival, falling anywhere between March 22 and April 25. A movement is going on for narrowing down the range of variation of the Easter day ; in 1928 the British Parliament passed the Easter Act, which contingent upon its acceptance internationally, fixed Easter day as the first Sunday after the second Baturday in April, falling between April 9 and 15.

The objections to the World Calendar plan come from several Jewish organizations, on the ground that the World Calendar plan interferes with the unbroken seven-day week, by introducing Worlds day and Leap-year. Day without any week-day denomination. This, they say, will interfere with their religious life. 



As already shown, the religious sanction for the seven-day cycle is either non-existent, or slight, amongst communities other than the Jews, and even amongst them, it dates only from the first century A. D. The claims of certain Jewish Rabbis to prove that the seven-day week cycle has been ordained by God Almighty from the moment of creation which event, according to these Jewish Rabbis, took place on the day of the autumnal equinox, also a new moon day, is a fantastic conception of medieval scholars, which no sane man can entertain in these days of Darwin and Einstein, 



fraction of people who would want to observe their religious rites according to established usage. 



But these inconveniences can be adjusted by agreement, and it would be egoistical on the part of a particular community or communities to try to impede the passage of a measure of such great useful ness to the whole of mankind on the plea that the World Calendar plan interferes with the continuous seven-day week. Calendars are based on Science, which everybody must bow to ; and on Convention, which may be altered by mutual consent. The unbroken seven-day week is a Convention, but the World Calendar plan bas proposed a far better Conven tion, which should be examined on its own merits.* 



As a result of a request from the Government of India, the proposal of the World Calendar Reform had become the subject of discussion at the eighteenth session of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations held at Geneva during June-July, 1954. Professor M. N. Saha, F. R. S., Chairman, Calendar Reform Committee, attended the ECOSOC meeting at Geneva to explain the desirability of the proposed reform. 



The World Calendar plan has no intention of interfering with the characteristic calendars of communities or nations. They can exist side by side with the World Calendar. For such communities as intend to maintain the continuous seven-day week, their religious week-days, including Sundays, would no doubt wander through the World Calendar week days, and cause some inconvenience to the very small
