'Tithi' or 'Lunar Day' is a very important concep tion in Hindu astronomy, for holidays are always dated by the tithi. According to Siddhāntic definition, a lithi 

The history of the Indian calendar from the end of the Yajurveda period to the beginning of the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa period is very imperfectly known though there are plenty of calendaric references in the Brāhmanās, Sūtras, and the epic Mahābhārata and various literature. On time-scale, it extends from

Note :--The Vodic tithi ends at moonset in the light half and at moonrise in the dark half. Near amavasya when the moon remains invisible, the ending is at sunset. There are 29 or 30 such tithis in a lunar month, and all 'ithis are of more than 24 hours' duration except amāvasyā and purnimā which are of about 12 hours' duration. 

an unknown antiquity, which is set by some at 1300 B.C. to 900 A.D. 

The Vedanga Jyotupa is generally assigned to this period. It may be said to be a sort of collection of short aphorisms giving mathematical rules for fixing the calendar in advance, and is known in three versions : the Rg-Jyotiṣa consisting of 36 verses, attached to the Rg-Veda and ascribed to one Lagadha 

as mentioned earlier, the Yājuṣ Jyotiṇa attached to the Yajurveda and consisting of 43 verses, and there is a text ascribed to one Somakara, a commentator of unknown age of the Vedas. The dffferent texts contain about the same matter, but the verses are haphazardly arranged showing that the original texts have not come down to us in an unadulterated form. The number of independent, verses in all the versions 

INDIAN CALENDAR 

223 

is not more than 49, and some of the verses have not been interpreted. 

There are several other calendarical treatises which can be assigned to this period. The Surya Prajnapti, a Jaina astronomical work, the Jyotisakaranda, and the Kalalokaprakaśa. 

A short account of the calendaric rules followed in these treatises is given in Varāhamihira's Pañca Siddhāntika, Chap. XII, where the rules are collected as "Paitāmaha Siddhānta" or Astronomical Calendar according to Grandfather Brahma, the Creator, in Hindu mythology. That shows the high antiquity of the rules. Varāhamihira, as well as Brahmagupta describe the rules as very "inaccurate" (Daravibhrastau, furthest from truth in Varahamihira's language) though they pay a formal courtesy to the supposed authors. But such has been the case with calendars of all ancient nations, including the Babylonians at this period and a critical account of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa is important from the historical point of view. 

It may be remarked here that there are minor differences between Vedānga Jyotiṣa, the Jain systems, and the Paitāmaha Siddhānta, which appear to be the latest of this group. The older treatises have a year of 366 days, while the Paitamaha Siddhānta has a year of 365-3569 days (Dıkṣit). 

There is an extensive literature on Vedanga Jyotoṣa which has been studied by Dr. G. Thibaut, S. B. Diksit, S. K. Pillai, and Dr. R. Shama Sastry, amongst others. We hiere give an account of the calendar according to the Paitāmaha Siddhānta. 

The Vedānga Jyotisa further describes measure ments of the subdivisions of the day by means of the clepsydra, as well as by gnomon-shadows. 

One particular feature is the assumption that the ratio of the length of the day to that of the night on the summer solstice day is as 3.: 2. 

Let us now examine these points critically. 

We observe that all the mathematical rules point out only to mean motions of the sun and the moon, i.e, the periods of the sun and the moon were obtained by counting the number of sāvana days in a large number of years and months, and dividing the number by the number of periods (year or month). No evidence is found of the systematic day to day observations of the sun and the moon. Only the lunar zodiac was used for describing the positions of the sun and the moon, which appears to have been divided into 27 equal parts or nakṣatras ; in other words the nakṣatras no longer denoted star-clusters but equal divisions of the lunar belt. 

There is no mention of the zodiac or twelve signs of the zodiac, or of week days, or of planetary motion, 

Let us now look critically into the rules.. 

5 solar years. = 365.2422 x 5-1826.2110 days; 62 synodic months=29.53059 x 62-1830.8965 days ; 67 sidereal months=27.32166 x 67=1830.5512 days. 

Summary of the Contents 

"Five years constitute a Yuga or Saros of the sun and the moon. 

The yuga comprises 1830 sāvana days (civil days) and 1860 tithis (lunar days). 

In the yuga, there are 62 lunar months and 60 solar months. So two months are omitted as intercalary. months, in a period of 5 years. 

The number of omitted tithis in the period is 30. 

There are 67 naksatra-months (sidereal months) in the yugu The moon passes through 67 x 27=1809 nakṣatras within this period.. 

The yuga begins at winter solstice with the sun, and the moon together at the Dhaniṣthā asterism (a or B Delphini)." 

These are the main points from which the five yearly calendar can be constructed. 

Therefore, regarded as a measure for luni-solar adjustment, the error is 4.685 days in a period of 5 years, i.e., if we started a yuga with the sun and the moon together on the winter solstice day, the beginning of the next yuga (6th year) would occur. 4.685 days later than the winter solstice and in 5 to 6 yugas the discrepancy would amount to a month or half season. This cannot escape notice, and therefore there must have been some way of bringing back the yuga to the winter solstice day. Otherwise the calendar becomes useless. But how could it have been done ? . This is a matter for conjecture and several hypotheses have been proposed. According to S. B. Dikṣit, we should have in 95 years : 

according to the V. J., x 95-38 intercalary months, while actually we have, I'o x 95-35 intercalary months. 

So the Vedanga Jyotiṣa rules introduce 3 more intercalary months than necessary in 95 years, and if these are dropped, we can have good adjustment. This could have been done as follows : 

In the first period of 30 years-6 yugas, suppose they had 11 intercalary months instead of 12. 

The beginning of the yuga would go ahead of the winter solstice in 30 years by 4685 X6-28.110 days. 

224 

The mistake was .000305 days on the lower side of 1 nakṣatra in 3279 days or about 9 years. 

But if we do not have the intercalary month on the 30th year, the "yuga-beginning is brought back to 29.53–28.110- 1.421 days before the W.S. day. The same process is repeated for the next period of 30 years. The yugd-beginning is thus brought back to 2.842 days before the W.S. day. 

The next period may be taken to consist of 35 years, i.e., 7 yugas each of five years, in which the yuga beginning goes ahead by 3.264 days. The combined result of the three periods of 30, 30, and 35 years is to put the yuga beginning ahead of the W.S. day by 0.422 days only. Other conjectural cycles are described by Dr. Shama Sastry. 

But was any such practice really followed ? We have no evidence from the verses ; but S. B. Diksit mentions that intercalary months were inserted only when needed, and hence probably they were 'dropped when not needed.' 

Tithis The main object of the Vedanga Jyotiṣa calendar appears to have been the correct prediction of the tithi and nakṣatra on any sāvana (civil) day within the yuga. In this respect, the rules were more accurate. A tithi is defined as asth of the lunar month. The correct measure is 

1 tithi - 29.530588 

v =.984353 days, . while the measure taken=$1=.983871 days. The mistake is .000482 days on the lower side or one tithi 

in 2075 days or in 54 years. 

The five yearly period consists of 1830 civil days in which there are 62 synodical months. 

We know 62 x 29.53059=1830.8965 days. Hence in order to make the tithi calculations correct, one day (exactly 0.8965 days) had to be added to the total number of civil days in the period. 

The Time of the Vedanga Jyotisha All recensions of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa contain the following verses : 

Svarākramete somārkau yadā sākam savāsavau Syāttadādiyugan māghastapah suklo'yanan hyudak. (6) Prapadyete graviṣthādau sūryācandramasāvudak Sārpārdhe dakṣiṇārkastu māghasrāvanayoḥ sadā. (7) These two verses taken together yield the following: 

The winter solstice took place at the lunar asterism Śraviṣtha, which is later called Dhaniṣthā. 

This is the 21st nakṣatra in the Krttikādi system and 23rd in the Aśvinyādi system and its component stars are α, β, y and 8 Delphini.* These stars are far away from the ecliptic. We have for 1950 : - 

a Delphini, Long. =316° 41' Lat. - +33° 2' B , j =315 39 

= +31 55 y , . = 318 40 

= +32 41 , . 318 35 

= +31 57

The Arabs have Band & Aquarii which also. represent the Chinese Hsiu. 

It has been stated in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa that the junction star of the asterism was placed at the beginning of the division and it marked the beginning of Uttarāyana or the W.S. day. Thus the star representing the Dhaniṣthā division had 270° as the longitude at the time when the tradition of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendar was formulated. If a Delphini is taken as the principal star of the asterism, then its longitude was 270° at the time of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa and in 1950, its longitude is 316° 41'. As the solstices take about 72 years to retrograde through one degree, the time of Vedānga Jyotiṣa is found to be (316° 41'--270°) ~ 72 46.07x72=3362 years before 1950 A.D. or 1413 B.C. The star ß Delphini, however, yields a somewhat lower period, i.e., about 1338 B.C. 

Nakshatras The days were named according to the nakṣatras or lunar asterisms in which the moon was found, and a lot of crude astrology* had grown up round this system. So it was necessary to predict the nakṣatra in advance. The Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendar prescribed some methods for such predictions. 

In a five yearly period of 1830 days, the sidereal revolutions of the moon amounted to 67 in which there are 1809 wakṣatras. 

Actually 1 nakṣatra day=51.74100 =1.011913 days, while the measure taken 1888 = 1.011608 days. 

The Plan of the Calendar 

In a period of 5 years, there are : 

1830 civil days, 62 lunar months, and so 1860 tithis, 

67 sidereal months and so 1809 nakṣatras. As the period contains 60 solar months, there are 2 intercalary months which are placed after every

* On & Dhanisthå day the moon got conjoined with both the B and a Delphinis at interval of 2 hours.

30 lunar months. Thus in the third year, the month Srāvana is adhika which is followed by śuddha Brāvana ; and in the fifth year the last month is also adhika which is adhika Māgha. 

There are 1860 tithis while the number of civil days is 1830 ; so there are 30 omitted tithis (tithi kṣaya). Each period of 61 days contains 62 tithis, so one lithi is omitted after 61 civil days. From this consideration the number of civil days per month can be obtained and will be shown in the table below. The Vedanga Jyotiṣa people regularly counted a tithi to a day, but after 61 days one tithi was omitted. 

As regards nakṣatras, their number is 1809 in 1830 civil days, the difference being 21. So 877 days were equivalent to 867 nakṣatras. They counted a nakṣatra to a day successively, but after every 87 days (actually 874 days), one nakṣatra was repeated for two days. 

The five different years of the period had distinctive names, vix., (1) Samvatsara, (2) Parivatsara, (3) Idavatsara, (4) Anuvatsara, and (5). Idvatsara. 

The plan of the five yearly calendar is shown below : 

period, and when it was added the last month adhika Magha contained 30 days instead of 29 days which was otherwise its due. 

The ratio , for the duration of the longest day to that of the shortest night given in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa was first noted by Dr. Thibaut. Later the same ratio was found by Father Kugler from Babylonian cunei form records of the Seleucidean period. The ratio is characteristic of a latitude of 350 N, which is nearly that of Babylon (for Babylon Ø=32° 40'N). Hence it has been inferred that the Vedānga Jyotiṣa-astronomers got this ratio from Seleucidean Babylon. But it may be pointed out that the Vedic life centred round North-Western India, from the Sarasvatī valley (Kuruksetra 0=29° 58') to Gandhar (§=31° 32'N). The ratios of the duration of daylight to, night on the summer-solstice day for different latitudes are as follows:

It is seen from the above table, that even at the latitude of Babylon, the ratio is not 1.50 but: 1.45. At Gandhār, it is 1.42. The difference is not very large. But there is another factor to which attention must be drawn. 

Both Babylonians and Indians measured subdivisions of the day by means of some kind of Clepsydra. A description of the Clepsydra used by Indians during the Vedanga Jyotéṣa-period will be found in S.B. Dikṣit's Bharatīya Jyotiśāstra (Sec. II, Chap. I). But 'the daya length must have been measured from the observed time of sunrise to the observed time of sunset. This is somewhat larger than the astronomical time of sunrise on account of refraction. Assuming that the effect of refraction is to elevate a celestial body near the horizon by about 35', and the sun's semi-diameter is about 16', the sun's upper limb appears on the horizon at a place on 32° latitude, about 45 minutes before the centre of the sun is due on the horizon. For the same reason, 'the sunset takes place 45 minutes after the astronomical 

As already shown, the actual length of 62 lunar months is 1830.8965 days, while there are 1830 civil days in the five yearly period. It is therefore very likely that one civil day was added to the period when necessary to make it conform to the phases of the moon which were regularly observed. This additional day was no doubt placed at the end of the 

226 

calculated sunget. So the apparent length of the day is increased bg 2* 44 min. or by 9 minutes. Therefore for the latitude of Babylon we have the length of maximum day-light 14h 12m +9m 14h 21m, and the night is gb 399 The ratio is now 1.49. Taking the effect of refraction into consideration the ratio for Gandhar also becomes 1.46, which is not much different from · 1.50 as for Babylon. So it is not necessary to assume that the ratio was obtained from Babylonian sources. 

: We get from this the time of composition of the Mahābhārata as about 450 B.C. or sometime earlier.. 

Varahamihira also notes that the winter solstice: no longer took place at Dhansstha. 

.. - Pañica Siddhāntika, III, 21 A śleṣārdbádāsit yadā nivșttiḥ kiloṣnakiraṇasya Yuktamayanan tadāsit sāmpratamayanam 

punarvasutab. Translation : When the return of the sun towards the south (1.., the summer solstice ) took place from. the middle of Aślesa, tbe ayana was right : at the present time ayana begins from Punarvasu. 

In his Brhat Samhita, an astrological treatise, he. records : 

Effect of Procession The Vedānga Jyotiṣa was prevalent for a long time over India, for over 1300 years (1000 B.C. to 300 A.D.). Hence it is likely that the subsequent astronomers noticed the gradual shift of the solstitial colure in the lunar-zodiac. In fact, several references are found to this effect. Garga, an astronomer whose name is found in the Mahabharata, where he is described as having an astronomical school at a place called Gargasrota in the Sarasvatī basin, is the reputed author of a pre-Siddhāntic calendaric treatise called Garga Samhita. . He notes : 

Yadā nivarta to'prāptaḥ śraviṣthamuttarāyape Aśleṣām dakśiṇo'prāptah tadā vindyanma had bhayam. 

Translation : When at the time of Ottarāyana the sun is found turning (north) without reaching the Sraviṣthās; and (at the time of Dakṣiṇāyana) turning (south) without reaching the Aśleṣā, it should be taken to indicate a period of calamity. 

It shows that at the time of Garga the W.S. did no longer occur in Śraviṣthā, neither the S.S. occurred in the Aśleṣā division. At the time of. Vedanga Jyotoṣa the two solstices were marked by the starting point of Śraviṣtha and the middle point of Asleṣā respectively. Garga therefore observed that the solstices were reced ing back over the lunar calendar, and had shifted at least by half a nakṣatra-division from the middle of Āṣleṣā. His observations are therefore at least 480 years later than those of the Vedanga Jyotiṣa. 

In the Mahabharata we get the following verse : 

Aśvamedha, Chap. 44;2: .. Abab pūrvani tatorātrirmāsāḥ śukládayalı gmịtāḥ Sravaṇādini çkṣāni staveb sisirādayah . 

Translation : Day comes first and then the night ; months, are known to commence with the bright half, the nakṣatras with Śravana, and the seasons with Sibira, 

Here the asterism Śravana is described as the one where the winter solstice takes place. śravaṇa is ust preceding Sravistha and the solstices take about 460 years to retrograde through one nakṣaira division. 

Brhat Samhitā, III, 1 Asleṣārdbātdakgiṇam uttaramayanan raverdbaniṣthôdyam Nūnaṁ kadācidāsīt yenoktani pūrvasõstresu. 

Translation : The beginning of the southern motion when the sun has passed half of Aśleṣā and the begin ning of the northern motion when the sun has passed the beginning of Dhaniṣthā, must have taken place at some epoch; for these are recorded in old treatises. 

From the time of Vedānga Jyotiṣa to Varāhamihira's. time the summer solstice moved through more than 14 nakṣatras ( f of Aslesá + Pusya ) which indicated a lapse of more than 1500 years from the time of Vedānga. 

Jyotiṣa. 

It is thus seen that the Hindu astronomers observed. the shifting of the cardinal points due to precession of the equinoxes ; but as they had not developed the sense of era, they were unable to find out the time. interval between different records, and obtain a rate for precession, as was done by Hipparchos. Their observations were also crude; as they used only the lunar zodiac. The shifting of the solstitial colures remained to them an unsolved mystery.
