and the names of the lunar mansions with their 

presiding deities, and talks of the sun's northernly and The Atharva Veda consisting mostly of magic southernly motion.

The month-names which are given here and repeated in many other verses of the Yajur Veda have been interpreted by all authorities to be tropical. Further this is probably the earliest mention of month names in Indian literature ; these names are no longer in use, and have been replaced by lunar month-names (Castra, Vaisakha, etc.) which are, however, found at a later stage. 

Madhu and Madhava have been taken in later literature to correspond to the time-period when the sun moves from -30° to 30° along the ecliptic, and so on for the other months. But we have no reason to believe that the Yajurvedic priests had developed such a fine mathematical sense of seasonal definition. But it is almost certain that they must have developed some method of observing the cardinal points of the sun's yearly course, viz., the two solstices and the equinoxes. From these observations, they must have counted that the number of days in a year was 366 in round numbers. 

The Yajur-Veda speaks in many places of the Utlarāyana, the northernly course of the sun from winter solstice to summer solstice and the Dakṣiṇāyana or the southernly course from summer solstice to winter solstice and the Viṣuvān, or the equinoctial point. The ayanas or courses must have received their designation from daily notings of sunrise on the eastern horizon. The year-long observation of shadows cast by a gnomon, of which we have evidences, may have formed an alternative method for fixing up the solstitial days, and the.cardinal points on the horizon, (vide Appendix 5-C), where some passages from the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa attached to the Rg-Veda are stated in favour of the view that the cardinal points were observed by means of the gnomon. 

Once they learnt to anticipate the cardinal days, determination of the month-beginnings marking seasons would not be difficult. The Madhu-month (the first month of spring) would begin 30 or 31 days before the vernal equinox day or 61 days after the winter solstice day, and the Madhava month on the day after the equinoctial day and so on. Average length of 303 days (909) would be given to each month, or 30 and 31 days to the two months forming a season. 

There are several points to be noticed in this list, which may be compared with the list given on p. 210. 

First, the nakṣatras start with Krttikās which all authorities identify with the conspicuous group Pleiades. What is the significance of this ? 

At the present times, the naksatras start with Asvini, of which the junction star is a or B. Arietis. This custom, Aśvinyādi, was introduced in Siddhānta Jyotiṣa time ( 500 A.D.), when the astronomical first point of Aries was near the end of the Revati nakṣatra ( § Piscium ), or the beginning of Afvini. We do not enter into the controversy about the exact location of this point by the Siddhānta astronomers, which is fully discussed in Appendix 5-B. At present, the astronomical first point had shifted by as much as 19° from ś Piscium, but the orthodox Indian calendar makers do not admit in the continued precession of the equinoxes, and still count the nakṣatras from Atvini. 

In all older literatures, on the other hand, including the great epic Mahābhārala, whose composition or compilation may be dated about 400 B.C., the first nakṣatra is Krttikā, It therefore stands to reason to assume that at one time, when the nakṣatra enumeration started, the Pleiades were close to the astronomical first point of Aries, or rose near the true east. This is implied in the following verse which S. B. Dikṣit picked out of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa : 

śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2.1.2. Ekam dve triṇi catvārīti vā anyāni nakgatrānyathaitā eva bhūyiṣṭhā yat kfttikā.... Etā ha vai prācyai digo na cyavante Servāni ha vã anyũni nakgatrani 

prācyai diśaścyavante. Translation :--Other nakṣatras have one, two, three or four ( stars ) only ; these Krttikās have many ( stars )... They do not deviate from the east; all other nakṣatras deviate from the east. 

The names as given in this list are somewhat different from those now adopted, which have come into vogue since 500 A.D.; for example, we have : 

No. 6 Tiṣya for Puṣya No. 16 Rohini for Jyestha ( There are thus two Rohinis, No. 2, and No. 16). No. 17 Vicrtau for Mula No. 20 Srona for śravaṇa No. 21 Śravistha for Dhaniṣtha No. 23 Proṣthapada for Bhādrapada No. 26 Aśvajuya for Asvini 

No. 27 Apabharani for Bharani . The more important question is whether the lunar mansions denote definite clusters of stars, or the nakṣatra-divisions of later times amounting to 13° 20' Or 800 minutes ? This point has been discussed in 8 4'1.

The Nakshatras 

One of the peculiar features of the Indian calendars is the use of the Nakṣatras as explained in § 4'1. Evidences have teen given that the custom started from Rg-Vedic times. But we come across a full list of Nakṣatras only in the Yajurveda' with names of presiding deities as given in Table No. 10 (p. 220 ), taken from Dikṣit's Bharatīya Jyotiśāstra.

taken as consecrated from the very beginning of the year. But such people have to accept one "nirya' ( draw back ), viz., that the Viṣuvān* occurs in the cloudly season ( sammedhya ). Hence, one should consecrate on the Citrā full-moon day. The Citrā full moon month is the 'mouth of the year. 

From these passages, we learn that the lunar month came gradually. The ancient Indians reckoned by the pakṣa or the fortnight, and distinguished the closing full moon day of the pakṣa by the nakṣatra where the moon was full. Thus Phālguni Paurṇamāsi is that full moon when the moon gets full near the Uttara Phalguni star (B Leonis ), one of the lunar mansions. Caitri Paurṇamāst is that full moon, when the moon gets full near the Citrā star (α Virginis ), which is the 14th lunar mansion. Later, as the months were always full-moon ending, the word paurṇamāsi was dropped, and, e.g., the first part of Caitra-Paurna māsi, i.e., Caitra became the lunar month-name. The above passage says that the Phālguna Paurnamāsi was regarded as the last day of the year and less frequently the Caitra Paurṇamāsi. This system still continues, and the first lunar month Caitra of the lunar year begins on the day after Phalguni Paurṇamāsi. 

There are twenty-seven nakṣatras and so only 12 can be selected for lunar month-names. 

The twelve names which we have got are : Caitra

is completed when the moon is ahead of the sun by 12°, or integral multiples of 12° ( vide § 57). 

Thus the first tithi ( Pratipada, lit, when the moon. is regenerated ) in the waxing half starts when the moon is in conjunction with the sun, and ends when she has gone ahead of the sun by 12°, when the second tithi of the waxing moon begins. The tithis are numbered ordinally from 1 to 15, the end of the fifteenth tithi being full-moon. Then begins the tithis of the waning moon, numbered from 1 to 15, the end of the 15th tithi being the new-moon. There are thirty tithis in a lunar month, and though the average duration is less than a solar day, being 23.62 hours, the length of individual tithis may vary from 26.8 to 20.0 hours., on account of irregularity in the moon's motion. 

This is the definition of the tithi given in Siddhāntas or scientific astronomy which started about 400 A.D. But this presupposes knowledge of measure ment of angles, and precise scientific observation, of which we find no trace in the Vedic literature. What was then the origin of this system ? 

We have no reference to tithi in the Rg-Veda. The first reference is found in Yajurvedic literature, and the Brāhmaṇas. The Taittiriya Samhita talks of the pancadasi tithi, which shows that the lunar pakṣa was divided into 15 tithis, counted by ordinal numbers from 1 to 15 for each pakṣa. But what was the time period meant by a tithi ? The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa attached to the Rg-Veda gives the following definition of the tithi. 

Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 32.10 

· Yām paryastamiyad abhyudiyāditi så tithih. 

The tithi is that time-period about which the moon sets or rises. 

This has been interpreted by Prof. P. C. Sengupta as follows: 

During the waxing moon ( śukla pakṣa ), the tithi was reckoned from moon-set to moon-set ;, and during the waning moon ( krsna pakṣa ), the tithi was reckoned from moon-rise to moon-rise. The tithis were thus of unequal length, as shown by Prof. P. C. Sengupta in Table No. 11 on page 222. 

Of course, full moon takes place by turn in all the nakṣatras. But only 12 at approximately equal intervals could be selected. But we have too Rauhinya paurṇamāsi etc. the pakṣa when the moon becomes full near Rohini, or Aldebaran ( lunar mansion No. 4). But Rauhinya' was not selected for the name of a lunar month, because it was too near Krttikā-Paurṇa māsī.
