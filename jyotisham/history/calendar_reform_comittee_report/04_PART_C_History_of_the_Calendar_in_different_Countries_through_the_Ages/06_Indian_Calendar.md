successive streams between 2500 B.C. and 1500 B.C. Others would go further back in time-scale from certain astronomical evidences. 

5.1 THE PERIODS IN INDIAN HISTORY The time-periods in Indian history necessary for our purpose are shown in the Chronological Table. 

The earliest civilization so far discovered in India is the Harappa-Mohenjo-Daro civilization (sometimes also called the Indus-Valley civilization) named after the two ancient buried cities of Harappa in the Punjab and Mohenjo-Daro in Sind. They were first brought to light by the late R.D. Banerjee, Superinten dent of the Western Circle of Archaeology of India in 1924. · It has now been ascertained that this civilization extended right upto Rupar on the Sutlej in the east and to the Narmada valley in the south. This civilization was certainly contemporaneous with the Mesopotamian civilizations of about 2500 B.C., nearly 500 years before the city of Babylon had risen to supremacy amongst the cities of Sumer and Akkad ; and with the first dynastic civilization of Egypt. How far back it projected into the time-scale is not yet known, but certainly many thousand years back. 

From the material records of the Indus-valley civilization, it is obvious that the Harappa-Mohenjo Daro people had attained to as high a standard of civilization, if not higher, as the contemporary people of Iraq and Egypt. But the script has not yet been deci phered ; it is therefore difficult to give a chronological history, but it is not so difficult to make a study of the attainments of this civilization is arts and sciences ; they could build well planned cities, used a drainage system superior to that of contemporary Egypt or Iraq, used copper and bronze, and had evidently evtoved a highly complex social organization. 

All civilized communities have been found to have evolved accurate systems of weights and measures and -some kind of calendar for the regulation of social life. We have some evidences of the use of standard weights and measures in the Indus valley. 

But had they evolved a calendar ? The presump tion is that they must have, but nothing has yet been discoverd amongst the artefacts left by these people so far recovered by the Archaeological Survey which tbrows light on the..calendar, or the system of time measurement they used 

It is held on quite sound grounds that the Harappa Mohenjodaro people were succeeded in the Punjab and in the valley of the now lost Sarasvatī river by the Aryan people who were either autochthonous or more probably came through Afghanistan in single or 

: Few, almost none of the materi 

artefacts of the early Aryans except some potteries tentatively ascribed to them, have so far been discovered. Almost the whole of our knowledge about them are derived from the hymns of the Rg-Vedas which were composed by priestly families amongst them in an archaic form of Sanskrit (Vedic Sanskrit), in honour of the gods they worshipped ; in these hymns are found occasional references to the sun, the moon, certain stars, and to months and seasons. Some think that there are also references to planets, i.e., the Vedic Aryans could distinguish between fixed stars and planets, but this is doubtful. From certain references which we discuss in § 5.2, we may conclude that they used an empirical luni-solar calendar. Probably this was used till 1300 B.C. We do not come across sufficient material records until we come to the time of Asoka about 270 B.C. 

What was the calendar during the period 1330 B.C.-250 B.C.? The Yajur Veda, the Brāhmaṇas, the Upaniṣads and other post Rg-Vedic literature, and the early Buddhistic literature contain occasional astronomical references, from which the nature of the calender used for ceremonical and other purposes can be inferred. The interpretation of the texts is neither easy, nor unambiguous. The latter part of this period has been called by S. B. Dikṣit, our pioneer in calendar research, as the Vedānga Jyotiṣa period. This is discussed in § 5.4. 

The Vedanga Jyotiṣa calendar appears to have been almost completely free from foreign influence, though this point of view has been contested. The Persian conqueror Darius conquered Afghanistan, and Gandhar, about 518 B.C. ; this region appears to have continued under the Achemenids for nearly two centuries. The Achemenids used a solar calendar probably adopted from Egypt in contrast to the luni-solar calendar of India, but this does not appear to have disturbed the indigenous luni-solar calendarical system. 

The Vedanga Jyotiṣa period, which as we shall show, was continued by Indian dynasts up to the time of the Satavahanas (200.A.D.), was succeeded by the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa period, but the first record of this period is available only about 400 A.D. "The transi

tional period from 100 A.D. to 400 A.D. is one of the . darkest periods in Indian chronology. Due to successive invasions by Macedonian and Bactrian Greeks ( Yavanas ), Parthians (Pallavas ), śaka's and Kuṣānas, the period from 300 B.C. to 200 A.D. is one of large foreign contacts which profoundly modified Indian life in arts, sciences, sculpture and state-craft. But the history of this period was entirely forgotten and is being recovered bit by bit from inscriptions, foreign references, and from artefacts recovered in excavations of the sites occupied by invaders of this period. Let us give a bird's eye view of the history of this period, imperfect as it is, so that the reader may follow without strain our account of the transition of the Vedanga Jyotiṣa calendar to Siddhāntic calendar. 

In 323 B.C., Alexander of Macedon raided the Punjab, but this incident by itself had no such profound influence on Indian life as is generally made out. Its influence was rather indirect. In India, it gave rise to a great national movement of unification under Candragupta and Canakya. In the former empire of Darius, it gave rise to a number of Greek states which became the focus of radiation of Greek culture throughout the East. The most important were Egypt under the rule of the Ptolemies, with capital at Alexandria, and the Near East under the Seleucids with capital at Babylon, which was succeeded a few years later by Seleucia a few miles distant from later Baghdad. In 306 B.C., Candragupta ind Seleucus faced each other, but the Greek army was rolled back to the borders of modern Iran, and almost the whole of modern Afghanistan except Bactria (modern Balkh) constituting the four satrapies of the old Persian empire were ceded to India. They continued to be politically and culturally parts of India till the tenth century A.D. 

(175-150 B.C.), who controlled the whole of Iran and wrested Bactria from the line of Eukratidas in 138 B.C. 

But inspite of these political happenings, Greek remained the language of culture throughout the whole Near East, from Asia Minor to North-Western. India. The Parthians since 128 B.C. called themselves 'Philhellens' or lover of Greek culture and used Greek on their coins, and the Graeco-Chaldean method of date-recording on their inscriptions. But about 140 B.C., a new power was on the move, viz., the Sakas from Central Asia ; they began to emerge as a ruling race from about 138 B.C. In 129 B.C. they attacked Bactria, and by 123 B.C. they wrested it completely out of the Parthian empire, after defeating and killing on the battlefield two successive Parthian emperors, vix., Phraates II (128 B.C.) and Artabanus I (123 B.C.). 

The early Śakas appear from their coins to have been under the spell of Greek civilization, and used Greek as a language of culture and put motifs taken from Greek mythology on their coins. Pressed by the next Parthian emperor, Mithradates II (123—90 B.C.), they poured by 80 B.C.,. into the whole of what is modern Afghanistan, except the Kabul valley, which the Greeks held for sometime. Their new territory became known as "Sakasthan' comprising modern Afghanistan and parts of N.W. India. From Afghanistan, they poured in successive streams to Malwa, Guzrāt, Taxila about 70 B.C., and to Mathura, somewhat later and had put an end to the numerous Greek principalities in the Punjab. Their further progress was barred by the Satavahanas in the South, and numerous small kingdoms which arose in the Gangetic valley on the break-up of the Sunga and Kanva empires (45 A.D.). After 50 A.D., the Sakas of the North were supplanted by the Kuṣānas belonging to a kindred race, and speaking the śaka language ; they ruled Northern India from their. capitals at Peshawar and Mathurā up to at least 170 A.D. Contemporaneously with them, were the śaka Satrap houses of Ujjain, who started ruling from about first century of the Christian era. 

. A chart of these historical incidents is attached for the sake of elucidation as they are necessary for the comprehension of the extent and amount of Greek culture, which was propagated into India, not so much through the Greeks directly, but as it appears now, indirectly through the early Śakas and their successors, the Kuṣānas. 

It now appears very probable that it was during the regime of the śaka and Kozana rulers (100 B.C. 200 A.D.) that a knowledge of the Graeco-Chaldean astronomy, which had developed in the Grecian world after 300 B.C. and ended with the astronomer 

The Mauryas kept out the Greeks till 186 B.C., when on the break-up of their empire, the Greek settlers in Bactria who had revolted from their overlords, the Seleucids, began to make inroads into India. There were two rival Greek houses, the earlier, the Euthydemids who under Demetrius and Menander (175 B.C.) took possession of the Punjab and Sind between 180 B.C. to 150 B.C. and threatened even Pataliputra but were rolled back beyond the Jamuna by the Sungas ; the line of Eukratidas who ousted Demetrius and his line from Bactria and Afghanistan propter about 160 B.C., reigned in Afghanistan up to 50 B.C. But there rose about 226. B.C., a great barrier between the Eastern Greeks (Bactrians and Indian Greeks) and the Western Greeks in the shape of the Parthian empire (248 B.C.), which became very powerful under Mithradates I 

214 

Ptolemy (150 A.D.), and in the Near East under the Seleucids (300 B.C. to 100 A.D.), penetrated into India, being brought by astronomers belonging to the śaka countries, who later were absorbed into Indian society as Śakadvipi or Scythian Brahmins. The borrowings appear to be more from Seleucid Babylon than from the west. The knowledge of Graeco Chaldean astronomy was the basis on which the calendar prescribed by the Surya Siddhānta and other Siddhāntas were built up. It completely replaced the former Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendar and by about 400 A.D, when the Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendar had completely disappeared from all parts of India. 

From 400 A.D. to 1200 A.D., almost the whole of India used calendars based on Siddhānta Jyotiṣa for date-recording. All Indian astronomers used the śaka era for purposes of accurate calculations, but its use for date-recording by kings and writers was generally confined to parts of the South. In general, the Indian dynasties used eras of their own, or regnal years, though the annual calendar was compiled according to rules laid down either in the Surya Siddhānta, the Arya Siddhānta or the Brahma Siddhānta. These did not much differ in essentials. 

When India since 1200 A.D. fell under Islamic domination, the rulers introduced the lunar Hejira calendar for civil and administrative purposes as well. Indian calendars were retained only in isolated localities where Hindus happened to maintain their ndependence, or used only for religious purposes. The emperor Akber in 1584 tried to suppress the Hejira calendar for administrative purposes by the Tarikh-Ilahi, a modified version of the solar calendar of. Iran, but this fell in disuse from about 1630., Since the advent of British rule in 1757, the Gregorian calendar has been used for civil and administrative purposes, which is still being continued. 

We have attempted to give below short accounts of calendars in use in different epochs of history. 

comprising the four Vedas : The Rk, Sara, Yajus, and Atharva. 

. (b) The Brāhmaṇas which are prose texts contai. 

· ning theological matter, particularly observations on 

sacrifices and their mystical significances ; attached to the Brāhmaṇas, but reckoned also as independent works are the Aranyakas or Upaniṣads containing meditations of forest hermits and ascetics on God, the world, and mankind. These treatises are attached to each of the individual Vedas. 

(c) The Sutras or Aphorisms, or Vedangas. 

Vedāngas', lit. limbs of Vedas, are post-Vedic Sūtra or aphorism literature which grew as results of attempts to understand the Vedas in their various aspects, and sometimes to develop the ideas contained in the Vedas. According to the orthodox view, there are six Vedāngas as follows: 

(1) Śikṣā : or phonetics; texts explaining how the Vedic literature proper is to be pronounced, and memorized. 

(2) Kalpa : or ritualistic literature, of which four types are known : Srauta Sutras dealing with sacrifices ; Grhya Sutras dealing with domestic duties of a householder ; Dharma Sūtras dealing with religious and social laws; Sūlva Sūtras dealing with the construction of sacrificial altars. 

(3) Vyakarana i or Grammar, e.g., Panini's famous Aṣtādhyāyī, which once for all fixed up the Sanskrit language. The Aṣtādhyāyi is however the culmination of attempts by large number of older authors, whose works were rendered obsolete by Panini' masterpiece. 

(4) Nirukta or Etymology: explanation of the Vedic words ascribed to one Yaska, who lived before Pānini. 

(5) Chandas-Metrics ascribed to Pingala. 

(6) Jyotiṣa-Astronomy: the Rg-Jyotiṣa is ascribed to one Lagadha, of whom nothing is known. 

Only the sixth Vedanga or Jyotisa interests us, though there are occasional references to the calendar in all Sātra literatures. 

Age of the Vedic Literature * 

5.2 CALENDAR IN THE RIG-VEDIC AGE 

( -1200 B.C.) The Vedic Literature : The knowledge of the calen dar in this age can be obtained only from the Vedic literature which consists however of different strata, greatly differing in age. According to the great orientalist Max Muller four periods each presupposing the preceding can be distinguished. They are : 

(a) The Chandas and Mantras composing the Samhitās or collections of hymns, prayers, incantations, benedictions, sacrificial formulas, and litanies 

The above gives the 'Philologists' stratification of the age of the Vedic literature. About the actual age of each strata, there is great divergence of opinion, though it is admitted that the oldest in point of age are the Samhitās, then come the Brāhmaṇas and

Upaniṣads, next the Sutras or the Vedangas. Of the four Vedas, the Rg-Vedas are by common consent taken to be the earliest in age and as Winternitz remarks, though all subsequent Indian literature refers to the Rg-Vedas, they presuppose nothing extant. 

· Max Muller made a rough assignment of age to the different strata as follows on the assumption that the Brahmanic and Upaniṣadic literature predated the rise of Buddhism, and that the Sutra literature which may be synchronous with the Buddhistic literature may be dated 600 B.C. to 200 B.C. Working backwards he assigned the Brāhmanic literature to 600 B.C. to 800 B.C., the interval 800 B.C. to 1000 B.C. 

· as the period in which the collections of hymns were arranged, and 1000 B,C. to 1200 B.C, as the period of the beginning of Vedic poetry. He always regarded these periods as terminus ad quem, and in his Gifford Lectures on Physical Religion in 1889, he expressly states "that we connot hope to fix a terminus a quo. Whether the Vedic hymns were composed 1000, 1200, 2000 or 3000 years B.C., no power on earth will ever determine. * 

It is not correct therefore to say, as some people say, that Max Muller had proved that 1200-1000 B.C. is the date of the Rg-Vedas. † 

. Other authorities, Schrader, Tilak, Jacobi, and P. C. Sengupta have found much older age for Rg-Vedic Indians : in fact, even as early as 4000 B.C., for some incidents described in the Rg-Vedas.* But their arguments, being based on interpretations of vague passages assumed to refer to astronomical phenomena have not commanded general recognition. 

Let us first look at the strata within the Rg-Veda itself. The Rg-Vedas are divided into 10 Mandalas (lit. circles ) or books. Of these, the 2nd to the 8th books are ascribed to certain priestly families, e.g, the 2nd book is ascribed to Gritsamadas, the 3rd to the Visrāmitras, etc. These are agreed to be the oldest parts of the Vedas. 

The ninth book is devoted to Soma which is an intoxicating drink pressed out of a plant. The drink was dear to the Aryans and is also mystically identified with the Moon. 

The first and the tenth books are miscellaneous collections ascribed to different authors. They are taken to be the latest in age. 

The Rg-Vedas consist of 1028 hymns, containing over 40,000 lines of verses. 

The Vedas are regarded as 'Śrulis' or "revealed knowledge preserved by hearing." According to savants, they were the outpourings of the heart and mind, of ancient priestly leaders, to their gods which were mostly forces of nature, intermingled very often with secular matter. Priestly families were trained to memorize the texts and pass them on to succeding generations in ways which guaranteed their transmi ssion without error or alteration of the text. Savants are almost unanimous in their opinion that the Rg-Vedic texts which were composed in an archaic form of Sanskrit, which was not completly understood even in 500 B.C,, have come to us without change. The orthodox Indian view that they are revealed knowledge is of course not shared by scholars, both eastern and western, who point out that very often in the text of the Vedas themselves and in Anukramanis or introductions to texts, the authors of each hymn are mentioned by name and family.. 

To which locality are the Vedas to be ascribed ? 

As regards locality, they are certainly to be ascribed to parts of Afghanistan, east of the Hindukush and the Punjab. The rivers of the Punjab, the Indus and its tributaries on both sides and the now lost Sarasvatī are frequently mentioned, the Ganges only once in a later text. The authors call themselves Aryas or Aryans, in contrast to the Dāsas or Dasyus who were alien to them, and with whom they came in frequent clash. The Dasyus are now taken to be partly Indus valley people, partly aboriginals. 

The Rg-Vedas describe a highly complex society of priests, warriors, merchants and artisans, and slaves but the rigid caste system had not yet developed. There are also references to cities, but no artefacts except some pottery, have yet been discovered. which can be referred to the Rg-Vedic Aryans. 

The Rg-Vedic Aryans, it appears, were con temporaneous (if not older) with the great civilizations of Mesopotamia, both Sumerian, and later Accadian, and according to one view, some of the royal families of Asia Minor, were probably 'Vedic Aryans'. It is therefore quite probable that they had attained as high a stage of civilization as that of Egypt of the Pyramid builders (2700 BC.), or of Sumer and Accad under Sargon I. 

Let us see what information we can gather about the calendar which they must have used for no civilized community can be without a calendar. 

* For details about Vedic antiquity, see Ancient Indian Chronology by P. C. Sengupta. 

+ It appears that Max Mūller has been a bit dogmatic in his opinion. Shortly after his death the names of the Vedic gode, Indra, Varuna, Mitra and the Nāśatyas in their Rg-Vedic forms were discovered in the Hittite clay tablets discovered at Boghaz Kuei in Asia Minor. They have been assigned to about 1450 B.C. More evidences about the Vedic Aryans were discovered in the excavations in the Sarasvatī valley now being undertaken by the Archaelogical Dept. of the Govt. of India. Further, fresh evidences are expected also in the archaelogical work undertaken in Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia.

Translation: Twelve spoke-boards: One wheel : three pavels. Who understands these? In these there are 360 sankus (rods) put in like pegs which do not get loosened". 

Further, the whole life of Vedic Aryans was centred round sacrifices to their great gods ; and sacrifices had to be carefully timed with respect to seasons, and moon's phases. In fact, some sacrifices were year-long, as Dr. Martin Haug, the great Vedic scholar remarks in his introduction (p. 46) to Aitarcya Brāhmaṇa (affiliated to the Rg-Veda). 

"The Sattras (or sacrifices) which lasted for one year, were nothing but an imitation of the sun's yearly course. They were divided into two distinct parts, each of six months of thirty days each ; in the midst of both was the Visuvān, j.l., equator, or central day, cutting the whole Sattra into two halves". 

This refers to somewhat later times than the Rg-Veda, but even during these early times, the sacrificial cult was fully developed. Let us see what references we get about the calendar from the Rg-Vedic times. 

The year is compared to a revolving wheel, whose circumference is divided into 12 parts (twelve months). They are grouped into three navels (seasons). 

Here also we have a year of 360 days, divided into 12 months, four months constituting a season, as we find in the oldest inscriptions. 

If the interpretation of the last passage is correct, we have the earliest reference to the later cãturmāsya system, or division of the year into three seasons each of four months. 

It appears from these passages that Vedic Aryans had once a year of 360 days as ancient Egyptians also had, but they discovered later that this was not the correct value either for 12 lunar months, or for a seasonal year. For the following reference shows that they used also a thirteenth month. 

Ķg-Veda, 1. 25.8 Veda māso dhỉtavrato dvādaśa prajāvataḥ 

vedāya upajāyate. Translation : Dhrtavrata ( Paruṇa ) knows the twelve months : (and) the animals created during that period; (and) he knows (the intercalary month) which is created (near the twelve months). 

This passage makes it clear that the calendar was luni-solar. But how was the adjustment made ? 

A hymn in the Rg-Veda first noted by Tilak comes to our help. 

Calendaric and Astronomical References 

in the Rig Vedas These are few, and interspersed along with other matter. This is not to be wondered at, for the hymns are addressed chiefly to the gods, Agni (sacrificial fire). Indra (the national warrior god), etc., and other references are only incidental. The direct references are found only in Books 1 and 10 which are later in age than the family books. 

Let us give the texts of a few hymns and their translations in English. 

Rg-Veda, 1.164.11 Dvada sāram nabi tajjarāya varvarti cakram 

paridyāmộtasya A putrā agne mithunāso atra sapta satāni 

vimśatisca tasthuh. Translation: The wheel (or time) having twelve spokes revolve round the heavens, but it does not wear out. Oh Agni !. 720 pairs of sons ride this (wheel). 

Here the year is likened to a wheel, having 12 spokes for months); the 720 pairs of sons are 360 days and nights. 

The interpretation commonly accepted is that the year was taken to consist of 360 days divided into 12 months, and the night and the day (following or preceding) constitute a couple. 

Rg-Veda, 1.164.48. Dvādas& pradhayascakramekam tripi nabhyāni

According to Tilak, the Kbhus are the genii of seasons. They are said to enjoy the hospitality of the sun for twelve days in the above verse. This passage, according to Tilak means the adjustment of the solar 'year with the lunar (sie., 366-354-12 days).* 

* cf. Ancient Indian Chronology, Chapter VI.

Another hymn from Atharva Veda (4.11.11) states that: 'Prajapati, the lord of yearly sacrifices after finishing one year's sacrifice, prepared himself for the next year's sacrifice'. 

The sacrificial literature of India still preserves the memory of these days by ordaining that a person wishing to perform a yearly sacrifice should devote 12 days (dvādaśāna) before its commencement to the preparatory rites. 

Did the Rg-Vedic Aryans have any knowledge of the lunar zodiac, or designate the days by the lunar mansions, as we find widely prevalent during later times ? 

There is no explicit reference to this point, but words which are now used to denote the lunar mansions are found in several verses of the Rg Vedas, e.g., 

Citra (a Virginis) is mentioned in RV. 4-51-2 

Magha (α Leonis ) is mentioned in RV. 10-85-13 but in these passages the meaning of these words is not very clear. 

The following references are more explicit. 

Atharva Samhita, 14.1.13 Sūryāyā vahatuḥ prāgāt savitā yam avāspjat Maghāsu hanyante gāvah pbalganipu vyuhyate. 

Translation : The first line is identical. In the second line, the only change is Maghā for Agha, and Phalguni for Arjuni. In the lunar zodiac, Magha stands for lunar asterism No. 10, of which the chief star is α Leonis. The two Phalguni stars, Uttara Phalguni (No.12) and pūrva Phalguni (No. 11) stand for ß Leonis and & Leonis. 

This verse shows that the custom of designating the day (it means day and night) by the lunar asterism in which the moon is found in the night, which is found widely in vogue in later times, and is used even to-day for religious purposes, was in use at the time when this hymn was written. The practice therefore 

dates earlier than 1200 B.C. at least. 

Rg-Veda, 5.54. 13 Yuṣmā dattrasya Maruto vicetaso rāyaḥ gyáma rathyo vayasvataḥ na yo yucchati tiṣyo yathā divo'sme rāranta Marutah sabasriṇań. 

Translation : You wise Maruts, we would like to be disposer of the wealth conferred by you on us ; it should not deviate (from us) as Tiṣya does not deviate from the heavens. 

Here one is tempted to identify the word 'Tisya' with the lunar asterism of that name, viz., Puṣya (8 Cancri). 

The following reference is more explicit. 

Longer periods of Time : The Yuga 'Yuga' is a very common word used in Indian literature of all times to denote an integral number of years when certain astronomical events recur. It exactly corresponds to the Chaldean word 'Saros' which has gone into international vocabulary. In later Indian literature we have Yugas of all kinds the five yearly yuga, sixty yearly yuga, and Mahāyugas of 4:32 x 106 years. Was any Yuga, known in Rg-Vedic times ?' 

There is evidence that some kind of a short period yuga, probably the five yearly yuga of later times, in which the moon's phases roughly recur, and which was the chief theme of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa was known in Rg-Vedic times as the following quotation shows : 

Rg-Sainhetā, 1.158.6. . Dirghatamā māmateyo jujurvān daśame yuge apāmartham yatinām Brahmā bhavati sārathih 

Translation : Dirghatamā the son of Mamatā having grown old in the tenth yuga became the charioter of the karma which leads to semi-result. 

The most rational explanation of the word yuga here is probably the five yearly yuga of Vedānga Jyotiṣa for it is rational to expect that a man becomes old after he attains the 50th year. But there have been other explanations. 

The Seasons and the Year The most commonly used word for year in the Indian literature is Varṣa or Vatsara. The word 

Versa' is very similar to Varṣā, the rainy season, and is probably derived from it. But curiously enough, this word is not found in Rg-Vedas. But the words Śarad (Autumn), Hemanta (early Winter) etc., are very often found to denote 'seasons" and sometimes years, 

Rg-Veda, 10. 85. 13 Sūryāyā vahatuh prāgāt savitā yamavāsșjat Aghāsu hanyante gāvo'rjunyoḥ paryuhyate. 

Translation: The (dowry) of cows which was given by Savita (Sun) had already gone ahead of Surya. On the Agha-day, the cattle were slain (acc. to Sayana had departed), on the two Arjuni-days, she was led to the bridegroom's house. 

This passage occurs in the famous bridal hymn, where the Sun god (Savitr) gives away his daughter Suryā to Soma (Moon) in marriage. It says that on the Agħā-day the cows, given as bridal dowry are, driven away ; on the two Arjuni-days, the bride goes to the bridegroom's house. 

This hymn is repeated in the Atharva Samhita as follows:

219 

The month-names which are given here and repeated in many other verses of the Yajur Veda have been interpreted by all authorities to be tropical. Further this is probably the earliest mention of month names in Indian literature ; these names are no longer in use, and have been replaced by lunar month-names (Castra, Vaisakha, etc.) which are, however, found at a later stage. 

Madhu and Madhava have been taken in later literature to correspond to the time-period when the sun moves from -30° to 30° along the ecliptic, and so on for the other months. But we have no reason to believe that the Yajurvedic priests had developed such a fine mathematical sense of seasonal definition. But it is almost certain that they must have developed some method of observing the cardinal points of the sun's yearly course, viz., the two solstices and the equinoxes. From these observations, they must have counted that the number of days in a year was 366 in round numbers. 

The Yajur-Veda speaks in many places of the Utlarāyana, the northernly course of the sun from winter solstice to summer solstice and the Dakṣiṇāyana or the southernly course from summer solstice to winter solstice and the Viṣuvān, or the equinoctial point. The ayanas or courses must have received their designation from daily notings of sunrise on the eastern horizon. The year-long observation of shadows cast by a gnomon, of which we have evidences, may have formed an alternative method for fixing up the solstitial days, and the.cardinal points on the horizon, (vide Appendix 5-C), where some passages from the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa attached to the Rg-Veda are stated in favour of the view that the cardinal points were observed by means of the gnomon. 

Once they learnt to anticipate the cardinal days, determination of the month-beginnings marking seasons would not be difficult. The Madhu-month (the first month of spring) would begin 30 or 31 days before the vernal equinox day or 61 days after the winter solstice day, and the Madhava month on the day after the equinoctial day and so on. Average length of 303 days (909) would be given to each month, or 30 and 31 days to the two months forming a season. 

There are several points to be noticed in this list, which may be compared with the list given on p. 210. 

First, the nakṣatras start with Krttikās which all authorities identify with the conspicuous group Pleiades. What is the significance of this ? 

At the present times, the naksatras start with Asvini, of which the junction star is a or B. Arietis. This custom, Aśvinyādi, was introduced in Siddhānta Jyotiṣa time ( 500 A.D.), when the astronomical first point of Aries was near the end of the Revati nakṣatra ( § Piscium ), or the beginning of Afvini. We do not enter into the controversy about the exact location of this point by the Siddhānta astronomers, which is fully discussed in Appendix 5-B. At present, the astronomical first point had shifted by as much as 19° from ś Piscium, but the orthodox Indian calendar makers do not admit in the continued precession of the equinoxes, and still count the nakṣatras from Atvini. 

In all older literatures, on the other hand, including the great epic Mahābhārala, whose composition or compilation may be dated about 400 B.C., the first nakṣatra is Krttikā, It therefore stands to reason to assume that at one time, when the nakṣatra enumeration started, the Pleiades were close to the astronomical first point of Aries, or rose near the true east. This is implied in the following verse which S. B. Dikṣit picked out of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa : 

śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 2.1.2. Ekam dve triṇi catvārīti vā anyāni nakgatrānyathaitā eva bhūyiṣṭhā yat kfttikā.... Etā ha vai prācyai digo na cyavante Servāni ha vã anyũni nakgatrani 

prācyai diśaścyavante. Translation :--Other nakṣatras have one, two, three or four ( stars ) only ; these Krttikās have many ( stars )... They do not deviate from the east; all other nakṣatras deviate from the east. 

The names as given in this list are somewhat different from those now adopted, which have come into vogue since 500 A.D.; for example, we have : 

No. 6 Tiṣya for Puṣya No. 16 Rohini for Jyestha ( There are thus two Rohinis, No. 2, and No. 16). No. 17 Vicrtau for Mula No. 20 Srona for śravaṇa No. 21 Śravistha for Dhaniṣtha No. 23 Proṣthapada for Bhādrapada No. 26 Aśvajuya for Asvini 

No. 27 Apabharani for Bharani . The more important question is whether the lunar mansions denote definite clusters of stars, or the nakṣatra-divisions of later times amounting to 13° 20' Or 800 minutes ? This point has been discussed in 8 4'1.

The Nakshatras 

One of the peculiar features of the Indian calendars is the use of the Nakṣatras as explained in § 4'1. Evidences have teen given that the custom started from Rg-Vedic times. But we come across a full list of Nakṣatras only in the Yajurveda' with names of presiding deities as given in Table No. 10 (p. 220 ), taken from Dikṣit's Bharatīya Jyotiśāstra.

taken as consecrated from the very beginning of the year. But such people have to accept one "nirya' ( draw back ), viz., that the Visuvān* occurs in the cloudly season ( sammedhya ). Hence, one should consecrate on the Citrā full-moon day. The Citrā full moon month is the 'mouth of the year. 

From these passages, we learn that the lunar month came gradually. The ancient Indians reckoned by the pakṣa or the fortnight, and distinguished the closing full moon day of the pakṣa by the nakṣatra where the moon was full. Thus Phālguni Paurṇamāsi is that full moon when the moon gets full near the Uttara Phalguni star (B Leonis ), one of the lunar mansions. Caitri Paurṇamāst is that full moon, when the moon gets full near the Citrā star (a Virginis ), which is the 14th lunar mansion. Later, as the months were always full-moon ending, the word paurṇamāsi was dropped, and, e.g., the first part of Caitra-Paurna māsi, i.e., Caitra became the lunar month-name. The above passage says that the Phālguna Paurnamāsi was regarded as the last day of the year and less frequently the Caitra Paurṇamāsi. This system still continues, and the first lunar month Caitra of the lunar year begins on the day after Phalguni Paurṇamāsi. 

There are twenty-seven nakṣatras and so only 12 can be selected for lunar month-names. 

The twelve names which we have got are : Caitra

is completed when the moon is ahead of the sun by 12°, or integral multiples of 12° ( vide § 57). 

Thus the first tithi ( Pratipada, lit, when the moon. is regenerated ) in the waxing half starts when the moon is in conjunction with the sun, and ends when she has gone ahead of the sun by 12°, when the second tithi of the waxing moon begins. The tithis are numbered ordinally from 1 to 15, the end of the fifteenth tithi being full-moon. Then begins the tithis of the waning moon, numbered from 1 to 15, the end of the 15th tithi being the new-moon. There are thirty tithis in a lunar month, and though the average duration is less than a solar day, being 23.62 hours, the length of individual tithis may vary from 26.8 to 20.0 hours., on account of irregularity in the moon's motion. 

This is the definition of the tithi given in Siddhāntas or scientific astronomy which started about 400 A.D. But this presupposes knowledge of measure ment of angles, and precise scientific observation, of which we find no trace in the Vedic literature. What was then the origin of this system ? 

We have no reference to tithi in the Rg-Veda. The first reference is found in Yajurvedic literature, and the Brāhmaṇas. The Taittiriya Samhita talks of the pancadasi tithi, which shows that the lunar pakṣa was divided into 15 tithis, counted by ordinal numbers from 1 to 15 for each pakṣa. But what was the time period meant by a tithi ? The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa attached to the Rg-Veda gives the following definition of the tithi. 

Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 32.10 

· Yām paryastamiyad abhyudiyāditi så tithih. 

The tithi is that time-period about which the moon sets or rises. 

This has been interpreted by Prof. P. C. Sengupta as follows: 

During the waxing moon ( śukla pakṣa ), the tithi was reckoned from moon-set to moon-set ;, and during the waning moon ( krsna pakṣa ), the tithi was reckoned from moon-rise to moon-rise. The tithis were thus of unequal length, as shown by Prof. P. C. Sengupta in Table No. 11 on page 222. 

Of course, full moon takes place by turn in all the nakṣatras. But only 12 at approximately equal intervals could be selected. But we have too Rauhinya paurṇamāsi etc. the pakṣa when the moon becomes full near Rohini, or Aldebaran ( lunar mansion No. 4). But Rauhinya' was not selected for the name of a lunar month, because it was too near Krttikā-Paurṇa māsī.

an unknown antiquity, which is set by some at 1300 B.C. to 900 A.D. 

The Vedanga Jyotupa is generally assigned to this period. It may be said to be a sort of collection of short aphorisms giving mathematical rules for fixing the calendar in advance, and is known in three versions : the Rg-Jyotiṣa consisting of 36 verses, attached to the Rg-Veda and ascribed to one Lagadha 

as mentioned earlier, the Yājuṣ Jyotiṇa attached to the Yajurveda and consisting of 43 verses, and there is a text ascribed to one Somakara, a commentator of unknown age of the Vedas. The dffferent texts contain about the same matter, but the verses are haphazardly arranged showing that the original texts have not come down to us in an unadulterated form. The number of independent, verses in all the versions 

INDIAN CALENDAR 

223 

is not more than 49, and some of the verses have not been interpreted. 

There are several other calendarical treatises which can be assigned to this period. The Surya Prajnapti, a Jaina astronomical work, the Jyotisakaranda, and the Kalalokaprakaśa. 

A short account of the calendaric rules followed in these treatises is given in Varāhamihira's Pañca Siddhāntika, Chap. XII, where the rules are collected as "Paitāmaha Siddhānta" or Astronomical Calendar according to Grandfather Brahma, the Creator, in Hindu mythology. That shows the high antiquity of the rules. Varāhamihira, as well as Brahmagupta describe the rules as very "inaccurate" (Daravibhrastau, furthest from truth in Varahamihira's language) though they pay a formal courtesy to the supposed authors. But such has been the case with calendars of all ancient nations, including the Babylonians at this period and a critical account of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa is important from the historical point of view. 

It may be remarked here that there are minor differences between Vedānga Jyotiṣa, the Jain systems, and the Paitāmaha Siddhānta, which appear to be the latest of this group. The older treatises have a year of 366 days, while the Paitamaha Siddhānta has a year of 365-3569 days (Dıkṣit). 

There is an extensive literature on Vedanga Jyotoṣa which has been studied by Dr. G. Thibaut, S. B. Diksit, S. K. Pillai, and Dr. R. Shama Sastry, amongst others. We hiere give an account of the calendar according to the Paitāmaha Siddhānta. 

The Vedānga Jyotisa further describes measure ments of the subdivisions of the day by means of the clepsydra, as well as by gnomon-shadows. 

One particular feature is the assumption that the ratio of the length of the day to that of the night on the summer solstice day is as 3.: 2. 

Let us now examine these points critically. 

We observe that all the mathematical rules point out only to mean motions of the sun and the moon, i.e, the periods of the sun and the moon were obtained by counting the number of sāvana days in a large number of years and months, and dividing the number by the number of periods (year or month). No evidence is found of the systematic day to day observations of the sun and the moon. Only the lunar zodiac was used for describing the positions of the sun and the moon, which appears to have been divided into 27 equal parts or nakṣatras ; in other words the nakṣatras no longer denoted star-clusters but equal divisions of the lunar belt. 

There is no mention of the zodiac or twelve signs of the zodiac, or of week days, or of planetary motion, 

Let us now look critically into the rules.. 

5 solar years. = 365.2422 x 5-1826.2110 days; 62 synodic months=29.53059 x 62-1830.8965 days ; 67 sidereal months=27.32166 x 67=1830.5512 days. 

Summary of the Contents 

"Five years constitute a Yuga or Saros of the sun and the moon. 

The yuga comprises 1830 sāvana days (civil days) and 1860 tithis (lunar days). 

In the yuga, there are 62 lunar months and 60 solar months. So two months are omitted as intercalary. months, in a period of 5 years. 

The number of omitted tithis in the period is 30. 

There are 67 naksatra-months (sidereal months) in the yugu The moon passes through 67 x 27=1809 nakṣatras within this period.. 

The yuga begins at winter solstice with the sun, and the moon together at the Dhaniṣthā asterism (a or B Delphini)." 

These are the main points from which the five yearly calendar can be constructed. 

Therefore, regarded as a measure for luni-solar adjustment, the error is 4.685 days in a period of 5 years, i.e., if we started a yuga with the sun and the moon together on the winter solstice day, the beginning of the next yuga (6th year) would occur. 4.685 days later than the winter solstice and in 5 to 6 yugas the discrepancy would amount to a month or half season. This cannot escape notice, and therefore there must have been some way of bringing back the yuga to the winter solstice day. Otherwise the calendar becomes useless. But how could it have been done ? . This is a matter for conjecture and several hypotheses have been proposed. According to S. B. Dikṣit, we should have in 95 years : 

according to the V. J., x 95-38 intercalary months, while actually we have, I'o x 95-35 intercalary months. 

So the Vedanga Jyotiṣa rules introduce 3 more intercalary months than necessary in 95 years, and if these are dropped, we can have good adjustment. This could have been done as follows : 

In the first period of 30 years-6 yugas, suppose they had 11 intercalary months instead of 12. 

The beginning of the yuga would go ahead of the winter solstice in 30 years by 4685 X6-28.110 days. 

224 

The mistake was .000305 days on the lower side of 1 nakṣatra in 3279 days or about 9 years. 

But if we do not have the intercalary month on the 30th year, the "yuga-beginning is brought back to 29.53–28.110- 1.421 days before the W.S. day. The same process is repeated for the next period of 30 years. The yugd-beginning is thus brought back to 2.842 days before the W.S. day. 

The next period may be taken to consist of 35 years, i.e., 7 yugas each of five years, in which the yuga beginning goes ahead by 3.264 days. The combined result of the three periods of 30, 30, and 35 years is to put the yuga beginning ahead of the W.S. day by 0.422 days only. Other conjectural cycles are described by Dr. Shama Sastry. 

But was any such practice really followed ? We have no evidence from the verses ; but S. B. Diksit mentions that intercalary months were inserted only when needed, and hence probably they were 'dropped when not needed.' 

Tithis The main object of the Vedanga Jyotiṣa calendar appears to have been the correct prediction of the tithi and nakṣatra on any sāvana (civil) day within the yuga. In this respect, the rules were more accurate. A tithi is defined as asth of the lunar month. The correct measure is 

1 tithi - 29.530588 

v =.984353 days, . while the measure taken=$1=.983871 days. The mistake is .000482 days on the lower side or one tithi 

in 2075 days or in 54 years. 

The five yearly period consists of 1830 civil days in which there are 62 synodical months. 

We know 62 x 29.53059=1830.8965 days. Hence in order to make the tithi calculations correct, one day (exactly 0.8965 days) had to be added to the total number of civil days in the period. 

The Time of the Vedanga Jyotisha All recensions of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa contain the following verses : 

Svarākramete somārkau yadā sākam savāsavau Syāttadādiyugan māghastapah suklo'yanan hyudak. (6) Prapadyete graviṣthādau sūryācandramasāvudak Sārpārdhe dakṣiṇārkastu māghasrāvanayoḥ sadā. (7) These two verses taken together yield the following: 

The winter solstice took place at the lunar asterism Śraviṣtha, which is later called Dhaniṣthā. 

This is the 21st nakṣatra in the Krttikādi system and 23rd in the Aśvinyādi system and its component stars are α, β, y and 8 Delphini.* These stars are far away from the ecliptic. We have for 1950 : -

The Arabs have Band & Aquarii which also. represent the Chinese Hsiu. 

It has been stated in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa that the junction star of the asterism was placed at the beginning of the division and it marked the beginning of Uttarāyana or the W.S. day. Thus the star representing the Dhaniṣthā division had 270° as the longitude at the time when the tradition of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendar was formulated. If a Delphini is taken as the principal star of the asterism, then its longitude was 270° at the time of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa and in 1950, its longitude is 316° 41'. As the solstices take about 72 years to retrograde through one degree, the time of Vedānga Jyotiṣa is found to be (316° 41'--270°) ~ 72 46.07x72=3362 years before 1950 A.D. or 1413 B.C. The star ß Delphini, however, yields a somewhat lower period, i.e., about 1338 B.C. 

Nakshatras The days were named according to the nakṣatras or lunar asterisms in which the moon was found, and a lot of crude astrology* had grown up round this system. So it was necessary to predict the nakṣatra in advance. The Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendar prescribed some methods for such predictions. 

In a five yearly period of 1830 days, the sidereal revolutions of the moon amounted to 67 in which there are 1809 wakṣatras. 

Actually 1 nakṣatra day=51.74100 =1.011913 days, while the measure taken 1888 = 1.011608 days. 

The Plan of the Calendar 

In a period of 5 years, there are : 

1830 civil days, 62 lunar months, and so 1860 tithis, 

67 sidereal months and so 1809 nakṣatras. As the period contains 60 solar months, there are 2 intercalary months which are placed after every

30 lunar months. Thus in the third year, the month Srāvana is adhika which is followed by śuddha Brāvana ; and in the fifth year the last month is also adhika which is adhika Māgha. 

There are 1860 tithis while the number of civil days is 1830 ; so there are 30 omitted tithis (tithi kṣaya). Each period of 61 days contains 62 tithis, so one lithi is omitted after 61 civil days. From this consideration the number of civil days per month can be obtained and will be shown in the table below. The Vedanga Jyotiṣa people regularly counted a tithi to a day, but after 61 days one tithi was omitted. 

As regards nakṣatras, their number is 1809 in 1830 civil days, the difference being 21. So 877 days were equivalent to 867 nakṣatras. They counted a nakṣatra to a day successively, but after every 87 days (actually 874 days), one nakṣatra was repeated for two days. 

The five different years of the period had distinctive names, vix., (1) Samvatsara, (2) Parivatsara, (3) Idavatsara, (4) Anuvatsara, and (5). Idvatsara. 

The plan of the five yearly calendar is shown below : 

period, and when it was added the last month adhika Magha contained 30 days instead of 29 days which was otherwise its due. 

The ratio , for the duration of the longest day to that of the shortest night given in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa was first noted by Dr. Thibaut. Later the same ratio was found by Father Kugler from Babylonian cunei form records of the Seleucidean period. The ratio is characteristic of a latitude of 350 N, which is nearly that of Babylon (for Babylon Ø=32° 40'N). Hence it has been inferred that the Vedānga Jyotiṣa-astronomers got this ratio from Seleucidean Babylon. But it may be pointed out that the Vedic life centred round North-Western India, from the Sarasvatī valley (Kuruksetra 0=29° 58') to Gandhar (§=31° 32'N). The ratios of the duration of daylight to, night on the summer-solstice day for different latitudes are as follows:

It is seen from the above table, that even at the latitude of Babylon, the ratio is not 1.50 but: 1.45. At Gandhār, it is 1.42. The difference is not very large. But there is another factor to which attention must be drawn. 

Both Babylonians and Indians measured subdivisions of the day by means of some kind of Clepsydra. A description of the Clepsydra used by Indians during the Vedanga Jyotéṣa-period will be found in S.B. Dikṣit's Bharatīya Jyotiśāstra (Sec. II, Chap. I). But 'the daya length must have been measured from the observed time of sunrise to the observed time of sunset. This is somewhat larger than the astronomical time of sunrise on account of refraction. Assuming that the effect of refraction is to elevate a celestial body near the horizon by about 35', and the sun's semi-diameter is about 16', the sun's upper limb appears on the horizon at a place on 32° latitude, about 45 minutes before the centre of the sun is due on the horizon. For the same reason, 'the sunset takes place 45 minutes after the astronomical 

As already shown, the actual length of 62 lunar months is 1830.8965 days, while there are 1830 civil days in the five yearly period. It is therefore very likely that one civil day was added to the period when necessary to make it conform to the phases of the moon which were regularly observed. This additional day was no doubt placed at the end of the 

226 

calculated sunget. So the apparent length of the day is increased bg 2* 44 min. or by 9 minutes. Therefore for the latitude of Babylon we have the length of maximum day-light 14h 12m +9m 14h 21m, and the night is gb 399 The ratio is now 1.49. Taking the effect of refraction into consideration the ratio for Gandhar also becomes 1.46, which is not much different from · 1.50 as for Babylon. So it is not necessary to assume that the ratio was obtained from Babylonian sources. 

: We get from this the time of composition of the Mahābhārata as about 450 B.C. or sometime earlier.. 

Varahamihira also notes that the winter solstice: no longer took place at Dhansstha. 

.. - Pañica Siddhāntika, III, 21 A śleṣārdbádāsit yadā nivșttiḥ kiloṣnakiraṇasya Yuktamayanan tadāsit sāmpratamayanam 

punarvasutab. Translation : When the return of the sun towards the south (1.., the summer solstice ) took place from. the middle of Aślesa, tbe ayana was right : at the present time ayana begins from Punarvasu. 

In his Brhat Samhita, an astrological treatise, he. records : 

Effect of Procession The Vedānga Jyotiṣa was prevalent for a long time over India, for over 1300 years (1000 B.C. to 300 A.D.). Hence it is likely that the subsequent astronomers noticed the gradual shift of the solstitial colure in the lunar-zodiac. In fact, several references are found to this effect. Garga, an astronomer whose name is found in the Mahabharata, where he is described as having an astronomical school at a place called Gargasrota in the Sarasvatī basin, is the reputed author of a pre-Siddhāntic calendaric treatise called Garga Samhita. . He notes : 

Yadā nivarta to'prāptaḥ śraviṣthamuttarāyape Aśleṣām dakśiṇo'prāptah tadā vindyanma had bhayam. 

Translation : When at the time of Ottarāyana the sun is found turning (north) without reaching the Sraviṣthās; and (at the time of Dakṣiṇāyana) turning (south) without reaching the Aśleṣā, it should be taken to indicate a period of calamity. 

It shows that at the time of Garga the W.S. did no longer occur in Śraviṣthā, neither the S.S. occurred in the Aśleṣā division. At the time of. Vedanga Jyotoṣa the two solstices were marked by the starting point of Śraviṣtha and the middle point of Asleṣā respectively. Garga therefore observed that the solstices were reced ing back over the lunar calendar, and had shifted at least by half a nakṣatra-division from the middle of Āṣleṣā. His observations are therefore at least 480 years later than those of the Vedanga Jyotiṣa. 

In the Mahabharata we get the following verse : 

Aśvamedha, Chap. 44;2: .. Abab pūrvani tatorātrirmāsāḥ śukládayalı gmịtāḥ Sravaṇādini çkṣāni staveb sisirādayah . 

Translation : Day comes first and then the night ; months, are known to commence with the bright half, the nakṣatras with Śravana, and the seasons with Sibira, 

Here the asterism Śravana is described as the one where the winter solstice takes place. śravaṇa is ust preceding Sravistha and the solstices take about 460 years to retrograde through one nakṣaira division. 

Brhat Samhitā, III, 1 Asleṣārdbātdakgiṇam uttaramayanan raverdbaniṣthôdyam Nūnaṁ kadācidāsīt yenoktani pūrvasõstresu. 

Translation : The beginning of the southern motion when the sun has passed half of Aśleṣā and the begin ning of the northern motion when the sun has passed the beginning of Dhaniṣthā, must have taken place at some epoch; for these are recorded in old treatises. 

From the time of Vedānga Jyotiṣa to Varāhamihira's. time the summer solstice moved through more than 14 nakṣatras ( f of Aslesá + Pusya ) which indicated a lapse of more than 1500 years from the time of Vedānga. 

Jyotiṣa. 

It is thus seen that the Hindu astronomers observed. the shifting of the cardinal points due to precession of the equinoxes ; but as they had not developed the sense of era, they were unable to find out the time. interval between different records, and obtain a rate for precession, as was done by Hipparchos. Their observations were also crude; as they used only the lunar zodiac. The shifting of the solstitial colures remained to them an unsolved mystery.

5.5 CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE INSCRIPTIONAL 

RECORDS ABOUT CALENDAR In this chapter, we are undertaking a critical review of the references to the calendar in ancient inscriptions, because, from the point of view of accurate history, inscriptional records are far more valuable than any references in ancient scriptures or classics, as they are contemporary documents, which have remained unaltered since the framers left them.. 

* Bometimes inscriptions and copper plate records have been found to have been forged at a latter date but such instances are rare and can not escape detection by an experienced archaeologist 

INDIAN OALENDAR 

227 

References in ancient scriptures, poems, epics and other literatures are, on the other hand, very often liable to alterations, interpolations and errors in the hands of latter-day copyists and are, therefore, less trust-worthy. 

The oldest inscriptional records bearing a date ( barring those belonging to the Indus-valley period which have not been deciphered ) belong to the reign of the Emperor Asoka ( 273-236 B.C.). From these, we can make fairly accurate deductions regarding the calendar then in use. 

We take the Fifth Pillar Edict, Rāmpurvā version found at the Champaran district, Bibar. The language is Asokan Prākrt, the script is the oldest form of Brāhmi. (Sircar pp. 62-63 ) 

Fifth Pillar Edict--Rāmpurvā Version (1) Sadĩsati[a]sabhisitena($advensat-targabhiji 

ktena)--After twenty-six years had elapsed 

since coronation'. (2) Tīsu cātummā[si]su tisyam pumnamāsiyain tini 

divasāni cāvudasam pamnadasan patipadam..... ( Tiszṣu cãturmāsīṣu tiṣyāyān pūrnamāsyām, triṣu divaseṣu.caturdaśe pancadaśe pratipadi...... 'On the three cãturmāsī days, on the tiṣya full 

moon day, on the 14th, 15th and the first 

day..............." (On these and some other days, sale of fish is 

forbidden). Again, in the same : 

(3) Athami-pakhāye cãrudasāye pamnadasāye 

tisāye punāvasune... ...(Aṣgami-pakṣe, catur-daśyāin, pancadaśyān, tiṣyāyāin, 

punarvasau............); 'On the eighth pakṣa, on the 14th, and the 

15th (new moon ) on the Tiṣya and 

Punarvasu Nakṣatra days........., (On these days, he forbids the castration of 

bulls). 

From these passages, we conclude that : 1. No era was used, but .regnal years ( number of 

years elapsed since the king's coronation ) 

were used for dating. 2. The time-reckoning was by seasons, each of 

8 pakṣas. The seasons are : Grīsma (Summer): Comprising Caitra, Vaiśākha, 

Jyaiṣtha, Astrid Varṣā (Rains) : Comprising? Śrārana, Bhadra, 

Āśvina, Kārtika. Hemanta (Winter): Comprising Agrahāyana, 

Parṣa, Māgha, Phālguna. 

3. The months are not mentioned by name, except 

in one case where the month of Māgha is mentioned. They are purṇimānta, i.e., they started after full moon and ended in full moon. This is not expressly mentioned but can be inferred from the fact that the 14th, the 15th (Pañicadaßi) and the Pratipada, i.e., the first tithi are enjoined to be the days on which certain actions are forbidden. These must be the three days of invisibility of the moon, the 14th being before new moon, the 15th the new moon, and the first, the day after new moon, which were observed as unsuitable for 

many particular performances. 4. The day reckoning was by the tithi (lunar day), 

but the word tithi is probably not to be taken in the sense of the present Siddhāntic tithi, but in the sense of the Vedanga Jyotisa tithi or the old Brahmanic tithi. In the latter system, a tithi was counted from moon-set to moon-set during the bright half, and from 

·moon-rise to moon-rise during the dark-half. 

There was the same tithi for the whole day. Prof. P. C. Sen Gupta has discussed this 

method of tithi reckoning (see p. 222 ). . 5. Two days are mentioned by the lunar asterisms 

Tiṣya (8 Cancri), and Punarvasu (6 Geminorum). As suggested one was probably his birth naksatra, the other his coronation naksatra. The days were therefore also named after the nakṣatra. This system is found in vogue in the epic Mahābhārata, e.g., in the following 

passage : Balarama, the elder brother of Krṣna, after returning from pilgrimage on the eighteenth day of the battle states : 

M. Bh., Salya Parva, Ch.34, 6 Catvāriṇsadahānyadya dve ca me niħsștasya vai Puṣyeṇa samprayāto'smi śravane punarāgataḥ.. 

Translation: It is forty-two days since I left the house. I started on the Puṣya (day) and have returned on the Śravaṇa. 

6. There is no mention of the year-beginning. 

The Tiṣya Purnamāsi, i.e., the full-moon day ending the lunar month of Pauṣa is marked 

out particularly. It appears from the records that in Asoka's time, the principles followed in framing the calendar were those given in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa. No era was used. From the inscriptions, we can make no inference about the luni-solar adjustment, but there is no doubt that the year was seasonal as given in the inscription of the Satavahanas (see next page). 

C. R.--37 

228 

No records bearing a date of the imperialdynasties following the Mauryas, viz., the Sungas, and Kanvas (186 B.C.-45 A:D.) are known. But the next imperial dynasty, the Satavahanas have left plenty of dated records. In these, the same system of date-recording by regnal years, the seasons, the pakṣas, and tithis are found. There are 8 pakṣas in a season of four months, and they were serially numbered from 1 to 8. The odd ones were Krṣṇa pakṣas, the even ones śukla paksas. 

Some examples are given below : 

(1) Nāsik Inscription of the Satavahana Emperor, Gautamiputra Sri Satakarni (Sircar, pp. 192-93). 

Data patikā Savachare 10+8 vāsapakhe 2 divase 1 

(dattā pritika Samvatsare aṣtādase 18 Varsāpakṣe 

divtiye 2 divase prathame 1). i.e. the inscription was recorded in the eighteenth year elapsed since the coronation on the first day of the second Paksa of the Varṣā season, i.e., in the lunar month of Śrāvana, on the first day after new moon (śukla pakṣa). 

There are other Satavahana inscriptions similarly dated as summarized in the table below : 

According to our calculations, the date of Gautami putra Satakarni would be about the first century A.D. We take some still later records. 

(2) Rāja Virapuruṣadatta of Nagarjunikonda (Sircar, 

pp. 220-221) Ramno Siri Virapurisadatasa Sava 6 vā pa 6 di 10 

(Rājfiah Sri Virapuruṣadattasya sainvatsare 

ṣaṣthe 6 rarṣāpakṣe ṣaṣthe 6 divase daśame 10. On the sixth year of King Sri Virapuruṣadatta on 'the 6th pakṣa of the varṣā season, on the tenth day. The sixth of varṣā pakṣa is month of Aśvina, second or light half (śukla pakṣa). - It is obvious from the above inscriptional evidences, that continuous era-recording was not used by Indian dynasts up to the time of the Satavahanas, and no ancient books, not even the Mahabhārata mentions an era. 

As no era is mentioned, it has been difficult to work out a chronology of the early Indian dynasts including the Satavahanas.

The number in the first column indicates the serial number of the inscription in Lūders' list. The last column contains dates, in an abridged form ; e.g., in 1123, we have 19, G 2-13. Here '19' is the regnal year, G denotes Griṣma or summer season, '2' following G denotes the second pakṣa, i.e., the second half of the month of Caitra, megaftituting the śukla pakṣa, and the last numeral '13' denotes the day. But it is not clear whether the day is the lunar day, i.e., the tithi or the solar day. Even if it be the tithi, it is probably not the Siddhāntic tithi, but the old Brahmaṇic or Vedanga tithi. 

The Coming of the Era to India As, we have seen in §3.5, the era reckoning had been in use in Babylon since 747 B.C., and the Seleucidean era which marked the accession to power of Seleucus at Babylon in 312 B.C., was widely current in the whole of the Middle East, both by the royalty and the public. 

But though as Asoka's Girnar inscription says that he was in diplomatic correspondence with five Greek kings of the West, including Antiochus I and II of Babylon, and the Ptolemy of Egypt, and sent Buddhist missionaries, to these countries, it is clear from his records that he continued to use the purely Indian methods of date-recording based on the Vedanga-Jyotiṣa. There is not the slightest indication that any of the Indian imperial dynasties which followed the Mauryas, viz., the Sungas and Kanvas (186 B.C.-45 A.D.), the Satavahanas ( 100 A.D.) allowed themselves to be influenced by the Graeco-Chaldean luni-solar calendar which was then in vogue in the Near East.. 

From about 180 B.C., North-Western India having Taxila as capital passed under the Bactrian Greeks. 

It is rather strange that though we have plenty of coins of the Bactrian Greeks who ruled in Afghanistan and N.W. India between 160 B.C., and 50 B.C., from which their names have been recovered, and some kind of chronology has been worked out, not a single record has yet been discovered which bears a date, except two doubtful ones. One is the coin of a certain Plato, found in the Kabul valley, which bears certain symbols which have been interpreted as 147 of the Seleucidean era, i,e., 165 B.C., Plato has been INDIAN OALENDAR

century A.D: The inscriptions are mostly in Kharoshi and later ones found on Indian soil are in Brahmi. The Kharoṣthi inscriptions are collected by Dr.Sten Konow in his monumental work Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol. II., Part I., and are reproduced below in Groups A and B.. : Group A is identical with Konow's A (with the omission of Nos. 20-23) and contains dates from year 58 to 200. Group B, identica with Konow's B-Group, contains the inscriptions of Kuṣāna period bearing dates of years between 300 and 400. 

identified by Tarn to be a brother of Eucratidas, founder of the second Greek ruling house (175 B.C: 139 B.C:) in Bactria. But the interpretation' is doubtful. 

The second one is an inscription of the time of king Menander, the great king of the Euthydemid house who ruled over the Punjab, Sind and Rajputana about 150 B.C., on the Shinkot Steatite Casket, the only one of the Greek kings who has found a permanent place in Indian literature in the celebrated Milinda Panho, a' philosophical treatise meaning questions of king Menander. The inscription referred to mentions regnal year 5, the Indian month of Vaisakha, and the twenty-fifth day. Thus the date recording is Indian, but slightly different from the system used in Asokan or Satavahana inscriptions because the paksa is omitted. 

Our studies given in § 33, shows that a mathe matically accurate luni-solar calendar, based on astronomical knowledge, was first evolved in Seleucid Babylon between 300 B.C. to 200 B.C. by Chaldean astronomers. The features of this calendar were : 

(a) The use of the Seleucidean era for numbering years in place of the regral years. 

(b) The beginning of the year with the lunar month of Nisan which was to start on a date not later than a month of the vernal eqxinox. 

(This corresponds to the Indian month of Vaisakha later defined in Siddhāntic calendars). 

· (c) There was an alternative method of starting with the Greek month of Dios which was to begin on a đate not later than a month of the autumnal equinox. 

(This corresponds to the Indian month of Kārlika, as later defined in Siddhāntic calendars). 

(8) Luni-solar adjustment was done by the nineteen year cycle (vide § 32-34). 

This system of date-recording spread far and wide in the Near East and was adopted by other ruling dynasties, viz., the Parthians, who however used an era starting from 248 B.C. They used Macedonian months without alteration. : . It can now be shown that this system penetrated gradually into India.

The month, mostly in Sanskrit ; the day, by its ordinal number, e.g., No. 11, which means in the year 111 on the 15th day of the month of Śrāvaṇa. 

The months are all in Sanskrit, except in No. 6, in which the month is in Greek (Panemos= Āsādha). No. 6 alone of this group contains the rather mysterious phrase 'Etaye pūrvaye' which means, 'before these'. This phrase, the meaning of which is not clear, occurs in Kuṣāna (Group B) and even in Gupta inscriptions. 

This method of dating is quite different from that of the contemporary Indian dynasts, viz., the Satavahanas, which mentioned regnal years, the season, the pakṣa, and then probably the old tithi or the lunar day. But it agrees with the method followed in contemporary Parthia, which mentions the year usually in the Seleucidean era, rarely in the Arsacid era, the name of the month in Greek, and the ordinal number of the day, which ranges from 1 to 30 (see Debevoise, 1938). From No. 10, it appears that whenever Indian months were used they were Purnimanta, following the classical Indian custom. 

which is supposed to stand for Azes. But this has been disputed. 

This series starts with the year 58, if Cunningham's reading of (1) with the additional reading of the king's name 'Moasa' is accepted. But even if we reject it, the series certainly starts with the year 68 in No. 5, and goes up to 136 at fairly small intervals, then to 168, 187, 191, 200 containing names of rulers known from coins, viz., besides Maues above mentioned, Gondophernes (103 = 20 B.C.), some Kuṣana king (122 = 1 B.C.), Devaputra Kuṣāna (136=14 A.D.), Mahārāj. bhrata Jehonika (191=69 A.D.). They are held to be dated in the same era, which is usually called the Old Śaka Era, shortly called O.S.E. But up to this time, there has been no unanimity amongst scholars about the starting date of the era used in inscriptions grouped under A. 

We now take the second group of inscriptions which are those of the Kuṣānas, who ruled in North India in the second century A.D. 

· Date of records of Group A None of the inscriptions of Group A appear to be 'Royal Records' but some contain names of kings, e.g., No. 6, which mentions a Mahārājā Mahamta Moga, who is taken to be identical with a king whose coins have been found in large numbers in Gandhara. He calls himself 'Maves' in the Greek inscription on the obverse, and Moasa (i.e. of Moa) in Kharoṣthi on the reverse. The title given there usually is Maharajasa Rajatirajasa Mahantasa. It is held that King Moga was śaka leader who starting from a base in Seistan or Arachosia, invaded Gandhara through the southern route, sailed up the Indus, and ousted the Greek rulers Archebius from Taxila, Artemidorus from Puṣkalavati and Telephos from Kapsā (Bachhofer, 1936) and founded a large empire comprising parts of Afghanistan, Gandbara and the Punjab. 

He is generally held to have been a śaka, but some hold without sufficient reason that he was a Parthian. He is the firstwef Indo-Scythian kings known to numismatics. He was followed by other Indo-Scythian kings in Gandhara, who are known from wide variety of coins issued, viz., Azes I, .Azilises and Azes II. But there is no clear reference to them in these ins criptions except the word 'Ayasa' in Nos. 10 and 15,

The second group Nos. 24-36 contains Kharoṣthi inscriptions of the Kuṣāna kings after the first Kaniska. These and Kuṣāna Brahmi inscriptions mention : 

Years from 1 to 98, the kings Kaniska I from 

1 to 24, Vajheska from 24-28, Kaniska II of the 

year 41, Huviska from 33-60, 

Vasudeva from 62-98. The King's name and the titles are given in full, and in the genitive. The era is generally ascribed to the famous Kaniṣka as we have a record of his first year. 

Their method of date-recording is the same as in Group A, viz., (see No. 25.) the year of the era, the month name in Greek or Sanskrit, the ordinal number of the day, then, the phrase equivalent to asyāin pūrvāyām ( before these to but in these inscriptions, it is expressed in the form ise kṣunami or its variant, which has been interpreted by. Konow as equivalent of asyāîn or etasyām pūrvāyān in the Khotani śaka language which Konow thinks was the mother tongue of kings of the Kaniṣka group and which they use in their inscriptions. In fact kings of this group use a number of Khotani śaka words, and from their wide range of coins are known to have put in a medley of Greek, Iranian, and Indian gods including Buddha on their coins, but the names of the gods are not in their original Indian, Iranian or Greek form but'invari ably in the form used in the Khotani śaka language. 

The method of date-recording followed by the Kuṣānas, in spite of its identity with that of Group A shows some interesting variations. In the Kharoṣthi inscriptions of the Kuṣānas, the months are mostly Greek, less so in Sanskrit ( Caitra, Vaiśākha, etc. ). The days run from 1 to 30 and clearly they are not tithis but solar days. When we turn to Brahmi inscrip tions, we find that the month names are mostly seasonal : Griṣma, Varṣā, or Hemanta as in the Satava hana records. But since 4 is the maximum number attached to these, and the day numbers run from 1 to 30, the number after the season denotes a month, not a pakṣa and the damnare solar. Thus G 4 denotes the fourth month of the Grisma season, viz, Aṣādha, and not the fourth paksa as was the case with the Satavābanas, which would be the second half of 

Vaiśākha. The pakṣa is given up. 

This is a deviation from Sātavāhana method of date-recording and follows closely the Graeco-Chal dean method. Some inscriptions mention Greek months (e. g. Gorpiaios which is Āśvina or Bhādra in Sircar's No. 49, p. 146 ) others Indian lunar months (e. g. Śrāvana in No.51 ), but their number is small compared with the seasonal mode of recording months. These inscriptions give no indication as to whether the month is Pūrnimānta or Amānta. The Indian months are Pūrnimānta. 

But the Zeda inscription of year 11 ( No. 26 of Group B) mentions that the nakṣatra was Uttaraphalguni on the 20th of Āṣādha, and (35) mentions that in the year 61, the nakṣatra on the 8th day of Caitra was Pārvāṣādhā. A comparison with tables of nakṣatras shows that the months ended in full moon (Pūrnimānta). As pūrnimānta months were unknown outside India, the Kuṣānas must have yielded to Indian influence and adapted their original time-reckonings to the Indian custom; at least in their use of Indian months.. 

Historians and chronologists now almost unani mously hold that all these inscriptions of Group B are dated in the same era which is sometimes called the Kuṣāna era, which was founded by King Kaniska. This is said to be proved by the fact that the inscrip tions range from year 1, and we have phrases as in No. 25 of the Mahārāja Rājādhiraja Devaputra Kaniska, in the year 11. But a little more scrutiny shows that it is only a conventional phraseology, used in almost all Kuṣāna inscriptions, for even in as late as an inscription of year 98 of this group, we read 'of the Mahārājā Vāsudeva in the year 98'. It is therefore by no means clear that such phrases can be interpreted to mean that Kaniska started an entirely new era. In fact, from Kaniska's profuse use of Greek months and Greek gods in his inscriptions and coins, Cunningham was led to the belief that Kaniska dated his inscriptions in the Seleucidean era, with hundreds omitted, so that year 1 of Kaniska, is the year -401 of S. E. and year 90 of the Christian era. 

But it has been known for some time that the Kuṣāna ëmpire did not stop with that Vasudeva' who comes after Huviska. Dr. L. Bachhofer (1936) has proved from numismatics the existence of : 

Kaniska III, reigning apparently after Vasudeva I, Vasudeva II, reigning after Kaniṣka III. 

The kings appear to have retained full control of the whole of modern Afghanistan including Bactria which appears to have been the home land of the Kuṣānas and some parts of the Punjab, right up to Mathura. . There is yet no proof for or against the point that they retained the eastern parts, after year 98 of Kuṣāna 

232 

éra. Herzfeld had established that Vasudeva II, who appears to have come after Kaniska III about 210 A.D., was deprived of Bactria by Ardeshir I, the founder of the Sasanid dynasty of Persia. The Sasanids converted Bactria into a royal.province under the charge of the crown prince, who struck coins closely imitating those of the Kuṣānas. Vasudeva II is also mentioned in the Armenian records of Moise of Khorene, a Jewish scholar, under the name Vabsadjan, as an Indian king who tried to form a league with Armenia and other older powers against the rising imperialism of Ardeshir. Vasudeva II is also thought to have sent an embassy to China about 230 A.D *. . 

The second Sassanian king Shapur I, claims to have conquered sometime after 240 A.D. 'PSKVR', which has been identified with Puruṣapura or Peshawar, the capital of the Kuṣānas. This has also been confirmed by the French excavations at Begram (Kapisi) in Afghanistan, which was destroyed by Shapur between 242 and 250 A.D. But this probably was not a permanent occupation but a raid, as a Kuṣāna king or Shah is mentioned in the Paikuli inscription of the Sasanid king Narseb (293-302 A.D.). 

Kushana Method of Date-recording In India : 

It appears rather strange that the Kuṣana way of date-recording should suddenly come to a dead stop on Indian soil with the year 98 of Vasudeva I, and no records containing a year number exceeding 100 should be found on Indian soil. 

The mystery appears now to have been successfully solved by Mrs. Van Lohuizen de Leeuw in her book The Scythian Period (pub. 1949). She has proved that several Brahmi inscriptions in the Mathurā region bear dates from years 5 to 57 in which, following an old Indian practice, the figure for hundred hąs been omitted. Thus '5' stands for 105, '14' stands for 114 of the Kuṣāna era. The following example will suffice (vide pp. 242-43 of The Scythian Period). 

One and the same person Arya Vasula, female pupil of Arya Sangamikā, holding the important position of a religious preacher in the Jaina community, is mentioned in two Brahmi inscriptions (No. 24 and No. 70 of Lūders) bearing the year designations of 15 and 86 respectively, the date-recording being in the typical Kuṣāna style. The palaeographical evidence also shows that the inscriptions were recorded in the Kuṣāna age, though the name of the reigning monarch 

is not mentioned. Now it is clearly impossible that: the same person would 'occupy such an important. position from the year 15 to 86, a period of 71 years. L. de Leeuw therefore suggests that while 86 is the usual Kuṣāna year (reckoning from year 1, of Kaniska), '15' is really with hundred omitted and represents actually the year 115 of Kaniska, i.e., dates of the two inscriptions differ by 115-86=29 years, which is much more plausible. In other words, after the year 100 of the Kaniska era was passed, hundreds were dropped in inscriptions found near about Mathura. 

The author has sustained her ground by numerous other illustrations, and there seems to be no doubt that this is a brilliant suggestion and it can be taken as proved that in numbering years of an era, hundreds were omitted in certain parts of the Kuṣana dominion in the second century of the Kaniska era. L. de Leeuw has found such dates in no less than 7 instances bearing years 5, 12, 15, 22, 35, 50, 57 in which apparently 103 has been omitted, so that 57 really stands for 157, and if we take the Kaniska era to have started from 78 A.D., the date of the last one is A.D. 235=(157 +78). Probably the name of the reigning king was not mentioned, as he had either lost control over these regions, or as the inscriptions were religious, it was not considered necessary. The second alternative appears to be more correct. 

This is supported by the inscription on an image discovered by Dayaram Sahni in Mathurā in 1927, It mentions Māhārāja Deraputra Kaniṣka. But on palaeographic grounds, he can neither be Kaniska I (1-24) nor Kaniska II (41), but a later Kaniska, coming after Vasudeva I, and 14 is really, year 114 of the Kaniska era. We may identify him with Kaniska III of Bachhofer. 

So we come to this conclusion : 

The records of Kuṣana kings, after Kaniska I range from year 1 to 98. In the second century of -the Kaniska era, hundreds are omitted and such records have been found up.to year 157, i.e., year 235 of the Christian era. 

This raises a strong presumption that Kaniska was not the founder of the era, but he used one already in vogue, but omitted the hundreds. · Thus year 1 of Kaniska is really year 1 plus some hundred, may be 1, 2, or 3. L. de Leeuw does not expressly suggest this, though it is apparent from her reasoning that year 1 of King Kaniṣka is year 201 of the Old śaka era*. If this suggestion be correct, since the old śaka era is taken to have started in 123 B.C. (-122 A.D.) instead of in 129 B.C., as postulated by L. de Leeuw, Kaniska started reigning in ( 201 – 123 )-78 A.D. . 

* The suggestion is of Prof. M. N. Saha. 

in 

* Ghirshman thought that the Vāsudeva Kuṣāpa of these references is Visudeva I, whose last reference is year 98. He equated year 98 of Kaniska's era to year 242-250 A.D., and arrived at the - date 144 to 162 A.D. for the initial year of the Kaniska era. But the 

equation of this Visudeva with Vásudeva I is certainly wrong. This must be Vasudeva II, or may be a still lator Vibadera.

233 

From the above review of inscriptional records and contemporary history, the following story has been reconstructed. 

(1) The. śaka era was first started in 123 B.C. when the Sakas coming from Central Asia due to the pressure of Hunas wrested Bactria from the Parthian emperors after a seven years' war. The leader was probably one 'Azes', and therefore the era was also alternately called the 'Azes' era. This Azes is not to be confounded with the two later Azes who succeeded Maues and reigned between 45 B. C. to 20 B. C. Earlier Sakas used Macedonian months and Graeco Chaldean method of date recording, prevalent throughout the whole of Near East. In Indian dominions, Indian months which were equated to Greek months were used. As their coins show, the ruling class had adopted Greek culture. 

(2) When the - Sakas spread from "Sakasthān', i.e., modern Afghanistan into contiguous parts of India, they began to be influenced by Indian culture. During the first stage, they exclusively used Greek in their coins, but later they began to use Kharoṣthi and Brahmi as well. The coins of Maues (80 B.C:---45 B.C.), Azes I, Azilises, Azes II show increasing influence of Indian culture. The southern Sakas who penetrated into Saurashtra and Malwa show Indian influence to a greater degree. . 

(3) In the first three centuries, they (Maues group, Nahapāna group and Kuṣānas) used the old śaka era omitting hundreds, and using a method of date recording which was an exact copy of the contem porary Graeco-Chaldean system prevalent throughout the Parthian empire (Macedonian months, and ordinal number of days). But they also began to use Indian months. Whenever they did it, the , month was Purnimānta, as was the custom with old Hindu dynasts (Mauryas and Satavahanas). 

(4). The classical śaka era starting from 78 A.D. is nothing but the old Śaka era, starting from 123 B.C. with 200 omitted, so that the year 1 of Kaniska is year 201 of the Old śaka era. 

The senior author has shown that Nahapjna used the old śaka bra with one hundred omitted, so that the year 46 of Nahapāna was the year 146 of the old śaka era or about 24 A.D. 

The Satavahana kings Gautamiputra Satakarni and his son Vasiṣthiputra Pulumaví, whose records are .found dated in the typical Indian fashion, reigned according to his hypothesis from about 40 A.D. to 80 A.D. From epigraphical record, Nahapana is at least separated by about 100 years from the next group of śaka rulers, viz., the Sakas of Ujjain belonging to the house of Caṣtana. 

The śaka satraps of Ujjain. We come across the records of another śaka ruling family, reigning in Ujjain. 

[Andau (Cutch) stone inscriptions of the time of Castana and Rudradaman, Sircar, p. 167].

Translation : Of king Castana, son of Jamotika and of king Rudradaman son of Jayadaman, in the year 52, on the dark half of the month of Phalguna and on 

the 2nd day.... 

This inscription mentions the year 52, the second day of the Krsna pakṣa of the month of Phālguna. 

There is no doubt that the year mentioned is that of the Baka era as now known. For this satrapal house reigned continuosly for nearly 300 years and has left a wealth of dated records. But the name of the era is not mentioned in the earlier records. They are mentioned merely as years so and so. 

The earliest authentic instance of the use of śaka era by name is supplied by the Badæmi inscription of Calikya Vallabhesvara (Pulakesin I of the Calukya dynasty), dated 465 of the śaka era (śaka- Varsanu Catus-sateṣu pañca-ṣasthi-yutesu : Epigraphia Indica XXVII, p. 8). In literature the use of the era by name appears still earlier. The Lokavibhāga of Simhasari, a Digambara Jaina work in Sanskrit is stated in a manuscript to have been completed in 80 beyond 300 (i.e. 380) of the śaka years (Ep. Ind., XXVII, p. 5). There is no doubt that the era used in the records of the western satrapal house beginning with Castana and Rudradaman have come down to the present times as the śaka Era, which is the 'Era' par excellence used by Indian astronomers for purposes of calculation. There ere 30 or more 'Eras' which have been in use in India (vide § 5*8), but none of them have been 

Śaka Era in the South-West. Besides the earlier Sakas belonging to the Maues group, and the Kuṣānas, there was another groupof śaka kings, who penetrated into the south-western part of India. The earliest representative of this group was Nahapana and his son-in-law Uṣavadata. Their records are dated in years 41 to 46 of an unknown era. They use Indian lunar honths and days (probably tathis). These Sakas ruled in Rajputana, Malwa, and northern Maharastra and were engaged in continuous warfare with the Satavahana ruler Gautamiputra Satakarni who claim to have destroyed them root and branch.

used for calendaricat calculation by the · Indian astronomers. 

Yet it is difficuit wo assign the origin of the śaka era to the western satraps. · An era can be founded only by an imperial dynasty like the Seleucids, the Parthians or the Guptas. The western satraps never claim, in their numerous records, any imperial position. They are always satisfied with the subordingte titles like Kṣatrapa (Satrap) or Maha Kṣatrapa (Great Satrap) while the imperial position is claimed by their northern contemporaries, the Kuṣānas, 

The conclusion is that the western Kṣatrapas used the old Śaka era, with 200 omitted ; so that year 1 of the present Śaka era is year 201 of the old Śaka era, i.e., (201-122)=79 A.D. . 

The gradual adoption of characteristic Indian ideas by the Sakas is shown in a record of Satrap Rudrasimha dated 103 S.E. or 181 A.D. 

[Gundā Stone Inscription of the time of Rudrasimha I, Sircar, p. 176]

• Translation : Of king Mahakṣatrapa.....of Svami Rudrasimha in the year 103 in the light half of the month of Vaiśākha on the 5th tithi and in the Robini nakṣatra muhurta,...... 

The śaka satrap Rudrasimba, reigning in 181 A.D. thus dates his inscriptions using an era (the śaka era), purely Indian months, tithes and nakṣatras. This is in full Siddhāntic style, because the characteristic features of Siddhāntic method of date recording which mention lithi and nakṣatra are first found in this inscription. The 'week day' is however not mentioned. 

This is first mentioned in an inscription of the emperor Budhagupta (484 A. D.).

6.6 SOLAR CALENDAR IN THE Siddhānta 

JYOTISHA PERIOD : Rise of Siddhāntas or Scientific Astronomy: 

The Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendarical rules appear, from inscriptional records, to have been used right up to the end of the reign of the Satavahanas (200 A.D.). The analysis of inscriptional data on methods of date recording given in § 5.5 shows that it was the śaka and Kuṣāṇa rulers (50 B.C. - 100 A.D.), who introduced the Graeco-Chaldean methods of date-recording, prevalent in' the Near East into India. These methods require a knowledge of the fundamentals of astronomy, which must have been available to the śaka and Kuṣāna rulers. In India, as 'the inscriptional records show, some purely Indian dynasts probably accepted the system in full from about 248 A.D. (date of foundation of the Kalachuri era, the earliest era founded by Indian kings, leaving aside the śaka era which is admittedly of foreign origin and the Vikrama era whose origin is still - shrouded in mystery). During the time of the Guptas who founded an era commemorating their accession to power in 319 A.D. the integration of the western system with the Indian appears to have been complete. 

Indian astronomical treatises, explaining the rules of calendaric astronomy, are known as Siddhāntas, but it is difficult to find out their dates. The earliest Indian astronomer who gave a date for himself was the celebrated Aryabhaṭa who flourished in the ancient city of Pataliputra and was born in 476 A.D. 

It is necessary to reply to a question which has very often been asked, but never satisfactorily answered, viz., 

Why did the Indian savants who were in touch with the Greeks, and probably with Greek science since the time of Alexander's raid (323 B.C.), take about 500-600 years to assimilate Greek astronomy, and use it for their own calendar-framing ? 

The Indians of 300 B.C. to 400 A.D., were quite vigorous in body as well as in intellect as is shown by their capacity to resist successive hordes of foreign invaders, and their remarkable contributions to religion, art, literature and certain sciences. Why did they not accept the fundamentals of Greek astronomy for calendarical calculations earlier ? 

The reply to this query appears to be as follows: 

The Greeks of Alexander's time had almost nothing to give to the Indians in calendaric astronomy, for their own knowledge of astronomy at this period was extremely crude and far inferior to that of the contemporary Chaldeans. The remarkable achieve ments of the Greeks in astronomy, and geometry,

though they started from the time. of Alexander. (Plato's Academy), really flowered in full bloom in the century following Alexander (330 B.Co - 200 B.C.). The culmination is found in Hipparchos of Rhodes who flourished from 160-120 B.C.; he wrote treatises on astronomy. Simultaneously in Seleucid Babylon, Chaldean and Greek astronomers made scientific contributions of the highest order to astronomy (vide § 4.7 & 4.8 ), but none of their works have survived, but are now being found by archaeological explorations. 

It is therefore, obvious that the Indians of the age of Asoka (273 B.C.—200 B.C.), who were in touch with the Greek kingdoms of Babylon and Egypt, had not much to learn from the Greeks in astronomy. 

The Maurya's were succeeded by the Sungas (186 B.C.--75 B.C.), but Indians during this age were in touch only with the Bactrian Greeks. But by this time, the Parthian empire had arisen (250 B.C.), producing a wedge between western and eastern Greeks. The only dated record of the Indo-Bactrian king, Menander (150 B.C.), is purely Indian in style. 

By about 150 B.C., direct contact between India and Greater Greece which included Babylon had almost ceased, due to the growth of the Parthian empire. Whatever ideas came, was through the śaka-Kuṣāna kingdoms which came into existence after 90 B. C. By that time, astronomy was regarded as only secondary to planetary and horoscopic astrology, which had grown to mighty proportions in the West. This may have been probably one of the main reasons for late acceptance of Graeco-Chaldean astronomy in India, for Indian thought during these years was definitely hostile to astrology. 

It will surprise many of our readers to be told that astrology was not liked by Indian leaders of thought, which dominated Indian life during the period 500 B.C.-1 A.D. Nevertheless, it is a very correct 

view. 

The Great Buddha, Whose thoughts and ideas dominated India from 500 B.C. to the early centuries of the Christian era, was a determined foe of astro logy. In Buddha's time, and for hundreds of years after Buddha, there was in India no elaborate planetary or horoscopic astrology, but a crude kind of astrology based on conjunctions of the moon with stars and on various kinds of omina such as appearance of comets, eclipses, etc. But Buddha appears to have held even such astrological forecasts in great contempt, as is evident from the following passage ascribed to him : 

Yathā vā pan'eke bbonto. Samaṇa-brāhmanā saddhā-deyyāni bhojanāni bhuñjitva te evarūpāya tiraccbāna-vijjāya micchājīvena-jībika m kappenti 

Translation : Some brāhmaṇas and framanas earn their livelihood by taking to beastly professions and eating food brought to them out of fear ; they say : "there will be a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse, occulta tion of the stars, the sun and the moon will move in the correct direction, in the incorrect direction, the nakṣatras will move in the correct path, in the incorrect path, there will be precipitation of meteors, burning of the cardinal directions (?), earth quakes, roar of heavenly war drums, the sun, the moon, and the stars will rise and set wrongly producing wide distress amongst all beings, etc." 

This attitude to astrology and astrolatry on the part of Indian leaders of thought during the period of 500 B.C. to 100 A.D., was.undoubtedly a correct one, and would be welcomed by rationalists of all ages and countries. But such ideas had apparently a very deterrent effect on the study of astronomy in India. Pursuit of astronomical knowledge was confused with astrology, and its cultivation was definitely forbidden in the thousands of monasteries which sprang all over the country within few hundred years of the Nirvana (544 B.C./ 483 B.C). Yet monasteries were exactly the places where astronomical studies could be quietly. pursued and monks were, on account of their leisure and temparament, eminently fitted for taking up such studies, as had happened later in Europe, where some of the most eminent astronomers came from the monkist ranks, e.g., Copernicus and Fabricius. 

Neither did Hindu leaders, opposed to Buddhism, encourage astrology and astrolatry. The practical politician thought that the practice of astrology was not conducive to the exercise of personal initiative and condemned it in no uncertain terms. In the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya, a treatise on statecraft, which took shape between 300 B.C. and 100 A.D., and is ascribed to Canakya, the following passage is found :

Aryabhaṭa and Varahamihira who made great scientfic contributions to 'astronomy belonged to this race. The planetary Sungod is always shown with high boots on, as in the case of Central Asian kings (e.g., Kaniska)... 

It is a task for the historian to trace how the steps in which the importation of western astronomical knowledge took place for the Siddhāntas, which incorporate this knowledge and are all a few centuries later, and many of them bear no date. . 

A good point d'appui for discussion is Vardhamihira's Panca Siddhāntikā.; for Varahamihira's date is known. He died in 587 A.D., in ripe old age so he must have written his book about 550 A.D. This is a compendium reviewing the knowledge contained in the five Siddhāntas which were current at his time. These were regarded as 'Apauruṣeya' or "knowledge revealed by gods or mythical persons”. 

Translation: The' objective (artha) eludes the foolish man (balam) who enquires too much from the 'stars. The objective should be the nakṣatra of the 

objective, of what avail are the stars? 

This may be taken to represent the views of the practical politician about astrology and astrolatry, during the period 500 B.C. to 100 B.C. 

Canakya was the great minister of Candragupta, and history says that these two great leaders rolled back the bordes of the Macedonians, who had con. quered the Acheminid Empire of Iran comprising the whole of the Near East to the borders of Iran; and thereafter laid the foundation of the greatest empire India has ever seen. They clearly not only did not believe in astrology, but openly, and without reserve, ridiculed its pretensions. 

But the influence of original Buddhism waned after the rise of Mahāyānist Buddhism, which received great encouragement during the reign of Kaniska (78 A.D. to 102 A.D.) and other Kuṣāna and śaka kings. Then came Buddhist iconography, coins, and knowledge of the methods of western date-recording which the Sakas and Kuṣānas used. They blended with the indigenous Indian system slowly. 

The focus of diffusion of western astronomical knowledge appears to have been the city of Ujjayini, capital of the western Satraps who were apparently the first to use a continuous era ( the śaka era ), and a method of date-recording which was at first purely Graeco-Chaldean as prevalent in Seleucid Babylon, but gradually Indian elements like the tithi and the naksatra were blended, as we find for the first time in the inscription of Satrap Rudrasimha, dated 181 A.D. (vide § 5.5). 

This city of Ujjayini was later adopted as the Indian Greenwich, for the measurement of longitudes of places. The borrowal of astronomical knowledge was not therefore from Greece direct, but as now becomes increasingly clearer, from the West, which included Seleucid Babylon, and probably : through Arsacid Persia. The language of culture in these regions was Greek, and we therefore find Greek words like kendra fcentre), liptika (lepton), horā (hour) in use by Indian astronomers 

This view is supported by the Indian myth that astrolatry and astrology were brought to India by a party of Sakadvipi Brahmanas (Scythian Brahmins), who were invited to come to India for curing Samba, the son of Krṣna, of leprosy by means of incantations 

· The five Siddhāntas are : 

Paitāmaha Ascribed to Grandfather Brahma. Vāsiṣtha Ascribed to the mythical sage 

Vasiṣtha, a Vedic patriarch, and 

revealed by him to one Māndavya. Romaka Revealed by god Viṣnu to Rṣi Romasa 

or Romaka. Paulisa · Ascribed sometimes to the sage 

Pulastya, one of the seven seers or patriarchs forming the Great Bear 

constellation of stars (but see later). Surya Revealed by the Sungod to Asura 

Maya, architect of gods, who 

propounds them to the Rṣis. . The five Siddhāntas are given in the increasing order of their accuracy according to Varahamihira. Thus Varahamihira considers the Sarya Siddhānta as the most accurate, and next in order are the Paulića, and the Romaka. The Vasiṣtha and Paitāmaha are, according to Varāhamibira, not accurate. 

Why were those Siddhāntas regarded as “Apaurus ṣeya" (i.e. not due to any mortal man) ? Dikṣit says (Bharatīya Jyotiśāstra, Part II, Chap. 1): 

"The knowledge of astronomy as seen developed during the Vedic and Vedānga Jyotiṣa periods and described in Part I, was wide as compared with the length of the period ; but it is very meagre, when com pared with the present position***. The oldest of astronomical knowledge (given in the oldest Siddbāntas) reveal .a sudden rise in the standard of astronomical knowledge. . Those who raised the standard as given 

INDIAN-CALENDAR 

We need not go any further into the contents of this Siddhānta. As the name indicates, the knowledge was borrowed from the West, which was vaguely known as 'Romaka' after the first century A.D. The yuga taken is quite un-Indian, but appears to be a blending of the nineteen-year cycle of Babylon, the five-yearly yuga of Vedānga Jyotisa, and the number 30 which is the number of tithes in a month. The length of the year is identical with Hipparchos's (365.2467), and this alone of the Siddhāntas gives a length of the year which is unmistakeably tropical. . 

• The Romaka Siddhānta appears to represent a distinct school who tried to propagate western astro nomical knowledge on the lines of Hipparchos. One of the later propounders was śrisena, who flourished between Aryabhaça and Brahmagupta ; the latter ridicules him roundly for having made a "kānthā”, i.ex a wrapper made out of discarded rags of all types meaning probably Sriṣena's attempt to blend two incongruous systems of knowledge, western and eastern. 

in these works were naturally regarded as superbuman. and hence the available ancient works on astronomy are regarded as: 'apauruṣeya' i.e. not compiled by mortal men) and it is clear that the belief has been 

formed later". 

This statement, made by Dikṣit nearly sixty years ago, really singles out only one phase of the issue, viz., the wide gulf in the level of astronomical knowledge of the Siddhāntas and that in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa ; but leaves the question of actual authorship open. In our opinion the Siddhāntas were regarded as Apauruṣeya because they appear to have been com pilations by different schools of the knowledge of calendaric astronomy, as they diffused from the West during the period 100 B.C.-400 A.D. But let us look into them a little more closely. 

The Paitamaha Siddhānta : described in five stanzas in Chap. XII. of the Panca Siddhāntikā. 

As already discussed it is a revised edition of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa ,but later authors say that it contained rules for the calculation of motions of the sun, the. moon and also the planets which were not given by the Vedānga Jyotiṣa. As the full text of the original - Siddhānta has not been recovered, it is difficult to say 

how the borrowal took place. 

The Vasistha Siddhānta : as known to Varahamihira is described in 13 couplets in Chap. II of the Parica Siddhāntika. It describes methods of calculating tithi and nakṣatra, which are inaccurate. Besides it mentions Rāśi (zodiacal signs), angular measurements, discusses length of the day, and the lagna (ascendant part of the zodiac). Apparently this represents one attempt by a school to propagate western astronomical knowledge, The school persisted and we have. Vāsiṣtha Siddhāntas later than Varāhamihira. One of the most famous was Viṣnucandra (who was somewhat later than Āryabhaṭa) who was conscious of the phenomenon of precession of the equinoxes. No text of the Siddhānta is available, except some quotations. 

Varahamihira pays a formal courtesy to Paitāmaha and Vāśiṣtha; this does not prevent him from describing these two as 'dūravibhraṣtau', i.e., furthest from truth. 

The Paulisa Siddhānta : This Siddhānta 'was at one time regarded as the ival of the Sūrya Siddhānta, but no“ text is available now. But it continued to be current up to the time of Bhattotpala (966 A.D.), who quotes from it. 

Alberuni (1030-44 A.D.) who was acquainted with it, said that it was an adaptation from an astronomical treatise of Paulus of Saintbra, i.e., of Alexandria. But it.is not clear whether he had actually seen Paulus's treatise, and compared it with the Paulisa Siddhānta or simply made a guess on the analogy of names merely, The name of one Paulus is found in the Alexandrian list of savants (378 A.D.) but his only known work is one on astrology, and it has nothing in common with Paulisa Siddhāntā, which appears to have been purely añ astronomical treatise as we can reconstruct it from the Pañca Siddhāutikā (vide infra). The ascription to Paulus.of Alexandria is not therefore proved. There is, however, reference in the Paulisa Siddhānta to Alexandria, or Yavanapura, as it was known to Hindu savants. The longitudes of Ujjain, and Banaras are given with reference to Alexandria (P.S., Chap. III). 

The Pañia Siddhāntikā devotes à few stanzas of Chaps. I, III, VI, VII, and VIII to this exposition of the Paulisa Siddhānta. Nobody seems to have gone critically into the contents of these chapters after Dr. Thibaut who tried to explain these in his introduction to the Panica Siddhāntika, but left most of them unexplained owing to their obscurity. 

In Chap. I. (verses 24-25), 30 Lords of the days of the month are mentioned. This is quite un-Indian 

The Romaka Siddhānta : The Romaka Siddhānta as reviewed by Varahamihira 

uses : 

A Yuga of 2850 years = 19 x 5x 30 years ; 

150 gears=54787 days ; 

1 year = 365.2467 «lays. The number of intercalary months in the yuga is given as 1050, i.e., there are 7 intercalary months in 19 years. 

and reminds one of the Iranian calendar in which each one of thirty days of the month is named after a god or principle (see § 2.3). The names of the lords of the days as given in the Paulisa Siddhānta are of course all Indian.

The Surya Siddhānta Of all the Siddhāntas mentioned by Varāhamihira this alone has survived and is still regarded with veneration by Indian astrologers. This Siddhānta was published with annotations by Rev. E. Burgess, in 1860, and has been republished by the Calcutta University under the editorship of.P. L. Gangooly, with an intro duction by Prof. P. C. Sengupta. . 

This is supposed to have been described by the ṣungod to Asura Maya, the architect of the gods, who revealed it to the Indian Rṣis. These legends certainly represent some sort of borrowing from the West, but it would be fruitless to define its exact nature unless the text is more critically examined. Varāhamihira describes in Chapters IX, X, XI, XVI, XVII of the Panca Siddhāntikā the contents of the Surya Siddhānta as known to him ; they are somewhat different from those as found in the modern text. It appears that this Siddhānta was constantly revised with respect to the astronomical constants contained in it as all astronomical treatises should be. The text as we have now was fixed up by Ranganatha in 1603 after which there have been no changes. Burgess, from a study of the astronomical constants, thought that the final text referred to the year 1091 A.D. Prof. P. C. Sengupta shows that the S.S. as reported by Varahamihira borrowed elements of astronomical data from Aryabhaṭa, and the S.S. as current now has borrowed elements from Brahmagupta (628 A.D.). 

The modern Surya Siddhānta is a book of 500 verses divided into 14 chapters, contents of which are described briefly below : 

Chap. I-Mean motions of the Planets. 

II–True places of the Planets. III-Direction, Place, and Time. IV-Eclipses, and especially Lunar 

Eclipses. V--Parallax in a Solar Eclipse, VI–Projection of Eclipses. VII—Planetary Conjunctions. VIII The Asterisms.. 

IX-Heliacal Risings and Settings. : 

X-Moon's Risings -and Settings, and 

the Elevation of her Cusps. XI-Certain malignant Aspects of the 

Sun and the Mocn. 

A scrutiny of the text shows that it is, with the exception of a few elements, almost completely astro nomical. A few verses in Chap. III, viz., Nos. 9-12 deal with the trepidation theory of the precession of equinoxes. These are regarded by all critics of the Surya Siddhānta to be interpolations made after the 12th century., 

It will take us too much away from our main theme to give a critical account of this treatise, but every critic has admitted that the text does not show any influence of Ptolemy's Almagest. Prof. P. C. Sen gupta's introduction is particularly valuable. This Siddhānta indicates that longitudes should be calculated from Ujjain and makes no mention of Alexandria. Prof. Sengupta thinks that it dated from about 400 A.D., but a scrutiny of the co-ordinates of certain stars marking the ecliptic, which we have discussed in Appendix 5-B, shows that it might have utilized data collected about 280 A.D., when the star Cierā la Virginis), was close to the autumnal equinoctial point, and is therefore subsequent to 280 A.D. 

The rules of framing the calendar are found in Chapter XII of which we give an account in the next section. 

After about 500 A.D., the Indian astronomers gave up the pretext of ascribing astronomical treatises to gods or mythical sages and began to claim authorship of the treatises they had written ; the earliest that has survived is that of Aryabhaṭa (476—523 A.D.). The objects of their treatises were to frame rules for calendaric calculations, knowledge of astronomy forming the basis on which these rules were framed. 

In addition to the Surya Siddhānta only two other systems have survived, viz., 

The Arya Siddhānta-due to Aryabhaṭa II, an astronomer of the 10th century, and supposed to be related to the Aryabhaṭīya of Aryabhaṭa, who claims to have derived it from Brahmā, the Creator. 

The Brahma Siddhānta-vaguely related to the Paitāmaha Siddhānta, but the human authorship is ascribed to the celebrated astronomer Brahmagupta (628 A.D.). 

But a number of astronomical treatises like that of Siddhānta śiromani by Bhaskaracārya and many others, have survived either on account of their own merit or their connection with astrology. INDIAN OALENDAR

Lanka, which is technically the name of a locality on the equator lying in the meridian of Ujjayini, which was the Greenwich of ancient India. This Laska had nothing to do with Ceylon, but is a fictitious name; 

90° west of Lankā the city called Romaka, and 90° east of Lanka the city known as Yamakoţi. 

The name Romaka vaguely refers to the capital of the Roman Empire. 'Yamakoți' is quite fanciful. 

The Surya Siddhānta takes it for granted that the sun's yearly motion through the ecliptic is known to the reader and now proceeds to explain the Signs of the Zodiac.

The Solar Calendar according to the 

Surya Siddhānta The first few verses of Chap. XII deal with the creation of the world according to Hindu conception, and the creation of the elements ; of the sun, the moon, and the planets. The universe is taken to be geocentric, and the planets in order of their decreasing distances from the earth are given as (vide verse 31,) : 

Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury 

and the Moon. The fixed stars are placed beyond the orbit of Saturn. 

Surya Siddhānta, XII, Verse 32 Madhye samantāt daṇdasya bhūgolo byomni tiṣthati Bibhrāṇaḥ paramām saktim brahmaño dbāraṇātmikāni. 

Translation : Quite in the middle of the celestial egg (Brahmānda), the earth sphere (Bhugola) stands in the ether, bearing the supreme might of Brahmā which has the nature of a self supporting force. 

The astronomers are thus conscious that the earth is a spherical body suspended in ether (byomni) 

Verse 34 : Describes the earth's polar axis, which passing through the earth's centre emerges as . mountains of gold on either side. 

Verse 35 : Gods and Rṣis are supposed to dwell on the upper (northern) pole, and the demons are supposed to dwell on the nether (south) pole. 

Verse 43 : Describes two pole-stars (Dhruva-tārās) which are fixed in the sky. 

The author could have been aware only of the Polaris. By analogy he inferred the existence of a southern pole-star which, as is well-known, does not exist. He had apparently no knowledge of the sky far south of the equator. 

The remaining verses describe the equator . As in modern astronomy, it says that the polar star is on the horizon of a person on the equator and the co-latitude (Lambaka) of the equator is 90°. 

The Siddhāntic astronomers thus completely accepted the geocentric theory of the solar system. It was a great improvement on the ideas of the world prevalent in India at the time of the great epic Mahabharata (date about 300 B.C.), in which the earth is described to be a flat disc, with the Sumeru mountain as a protruding peg in the centre, round which the diurnal motion of the celestial globe carrying the stars, planets the sun and the moon takes place. This idea of the world is also found in the Jātakas and other Buddhist scriptures. 

• In the subsequent verses four cardinal points on the , equator are recognized, these are : 

Translation : In the half revolution beginning with Meṣādi (lit. the initial point of Aries), the sun being in the hemisphere of gods, is visible to the gods, ; but while in that beginning with Tulādi (lit. the initial point of Libra) he is visible to the demons moving in their hemesphere. 

This means that when the sun reaches Meṣādi, the initial point of the sign of Aries, the gods who are supposed to be in the north pole just witness the rising of the sun and has the sun over the horizon for six months. All these six months, the demons who are supposed to be at the south pole are in the dark. It is vice versa for their enemies the Asuras for whom, dwelling in the south pole, the sun rises for them when it is at Tulādi (beginning of the Tula sign i.e., first point of Libra) and remains above the horizon for six months. 

According to the S.S., therefore, the first point of Aries is coincident with the vernal equinoctial point, and the first point of Libra with the autumnal equinoctial point. 

Surya Siddhāntā, XIV, 9 and 10 Bhānor makarasamkrānteh ṣanmāsā uttarāyanam Karkādestu tathaiva syāt gapmāsā dakṣiṇāyanan. 9 Dyirāśināthā stava stato’pi siớirāda yaḥ Megādayo dvādaśaite māsāstairova vatsarah. 10.

Thence also are reckoned the seasons (rtu), the cool season (sidera) and the rest,' each prevailing through two signs. These twelve, commencing with

These quotations leave not the slightest doubt that according to the compilers of the S.S., the first point of the zodiac is the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, and the signs of the zodiac cover 30° each of the ecliptic. 

It is supposed on good grounds that much of the astronomical knowledge found in the Surya Siddhānta is derived from Graeco-Chaldean sources. But it is clear from the text that the compilers of the S.S. had no knowledge of the precession of equinoxes, but they took the first point of Aries to be fixed. This is not to be wondered at, for as shown in § 4.9, inspite of the works of Hipparchos and Ptolemy, precession was either not accepted or no importance was attached to it by the astronomers of the Roman empire. It may be added that the compilers of the S.S. were not aware of the theory of trepidation of equinoxes which appears to have been first formulated in the West by Theon of Alexandria (ca. 370 A.D.). It is also important to note that the Indian astronomers did not take the first point of Aries to be identical with that given either by Hipparchos, Ptolemy or any other western authority as would have been the case if there was blind-folded borrowing. They assimilated the astro nomical knowledge intelligently and took the first point of Aries as the point of intersection of the equator and the ecliptic, and made successive attempts to determine it by some kind of actual observations, 28 shown in appendix 5-B. These observations appear first to have been made about 280 A.D. 

precession of the equinoxes, they were unaware of the distinction between the sidëreal year and the tropical year. They had to obtain the year-length either from observation or from outside sources. If they obtained it from observations, they must have counted the number of days passed between the return of the sun to the same point in the sky over a number of years. Such observations would show that the year had not the traditional value of 366 days given in Veranga Jyotiṣa, but somewhat less. In fact, the Paitāmaha length is 365.3569 days and there is no reason to believe that it was derived from foreign sources. Successive observations must have enabled the Indian savants to push the accuracy still higher.. 

Or alternatively they might have borrowed the value from Graeco-Chaldean astronomy, but we cannot then explain why their value is larger than Ptolemy's. We have seen that the Romaka Siddhānta gives a value which is Hipparchos's, and tropical, but the three more correct Siddhāntas reject it, as being too small. This however indicates that they probably tried to derive the length from observations as stated in the previous paragraph and found the Romaka Siddhānta-length too small. If they had taken it from some other source, we have still to discover that source. It is certainly not Ptolemy's Almagest. 

The ex-cathedra style of writing adopted by the Siddhāntic astronomers, e.g., the number of days in a Kalpa (a period of 4.32 x 10 years) is 1,577,917,828,000 according to Grandfather Brahmā, or the Sungod, does not enable one to trace the steps by which these conclusions were reached. 

The two problems of (i) distinguishing between the tropical year, and the sidereal year and of (ii) deter.. mining the correct length of the year in terms of the mean solar days are very exacting ones. 

We have seen how it took the West the whole time-period between 3000 B.C. to. 1582 A.D. to arrive at the idea that the true length of the tropical year was close to 365.2425 days. Probably Iranian astrono-. mers of Omar Khayam's time (1072 A.D.), who had the advantage of the great Arabian observations by al Baţțānī and others had a more correct knowledge of this length. The final acceptance of the distinction between the tropical and the sidereal year dates only from 1687 A.D., when Newton proved the theary of trepidation to be wrong. 

· The Siddhāntic astronomers of 500-900 A.D. cannou therefore be blamed for their failure to grasp the two problems. But what to say of their blind followers who, in the twentieth century, would continue. to proclaim their belief in the theory.of trepidation ? 

. 

. 

Length of the Year The length of the year, according to the different authorities are as follows.. 

Sūrya Siddhānta of 

days Varahamihira ... 3650 66 12m 369 = 365.25875 Current S.S. ..... 365' 6 12 36:56 <'365.258756 Ptolemy (sidereal) 365 6 9 48.6 a365.256813 Correct length of

N. B. Varāhamibira's length of the year is also found in Aryabhaṭa's ārdharātrika, or midnight system, and in Brahmagupta's Khanda Khôdya ka. 

How did the Indianrants manage to have such a wrong value for the length of the year? 

The year, according to the Surya. Siddhānta is meant to be clearly tropical, but as the Indian savants compiling the S,S..were:ignorant of the phenomenon of 

INDIAN CALENDAR 

241 

(a) Starting the astronomical year from the moment the sun crosses the vernal: equinoctial point. 

(b) . Starting the civil year on the day following. 

The Siddhāntic astronomers thus brought the Indian calendar on a line with the Graeco-Chaldean calendar prevalent in the Near East during the Seleucid times. 

In a few cases, e.g., in the case of the Vikrama era reckoning as followed in parts of Guzrat, the year. beginning is in Kārtika. This seems to be reminiscent of the custom amongst the Macedonian Greek rulers of Babylon to start the year on the autumnal equinox day. 

· Effect of continuance of the mistake The Surya Siddhānta value, viz., 365.258756 days is larger than the correct sidereal value by .002394 days and larger than the tropical length by .016560 days. 

As the S.S. value is still used in almanac-framing, the effect has been that the year:beginning is advancing by .01656 days per year, so that in course of nearly 1400 years, the year-beginning has advanced by 23.2 days, so that the Indian solar year, instead of starting on the day after the vernal equinox (March 22) now starts on April 13th or 14th. The situation is the same as happened in Europe, where owing to the use of a year-length of 365.25 days, since the time of Julius Cæsar, the Christmas preceded the winter solstice by 10 days, when the error was rectified by a Bull of Gregory XIII, and the calendar was stabilized by introducing revised leap-year rules. 

The Calendar Reform Committee has proposed that the Indian New Year should start on the day after the vernal equinox day. Most of the Indian calendar makers belong to the no-changer school, or the nirayaṇa school (i.e., school not believing in the precession of the equinoxes). But this school does not realize that even if the sidereal length of the year be: acceped, the Indian year-length used by them is larger by nearly .0024 days, which cannot be tolerated. So if a change has to be made, it is better to do it whole-hog, i.e., take the year-length to be tropical, and start the year on the day after the vernal equinox. 

. This is the proposal of the Indian Calendar Reform Committee, and it is in full agreement with the canons laid down in the Surya Siddhānta. 

The First Month of the Year : This has to be defined with respect to the defini tion of the seasons. 

. According to modern convention, which is derived from Graeco-Chaldean sources, the first season of the year is spring ; it begins on the day of vernal equinox, as shown in fig. 25 which shows also the other seasons. The Indian classification of seasons is however, different as the following table shows. 

Historical Note on the Year-beginning 

The Indian gear, throughout ages, has been of two kinds, the solar and the lunar, each having its own starting day. The year beginning for the two kinds of years, for different eras, is shown in Table No. 27. ,

The Siddhāntic astronomers, therefore, found themselves in a difficulty. If they were to follow the Indian convention, Caitra would be the first month of the solar year. If they were to follow the Graeco Chaldean covention, they had to take Vaisakha as the first month of the solar year. 

They struck a compromise. For defining the solar year, they took Vaisakha as the first month and for defining the lunar year they took Caitra as the first month (see § 57). 

But this rule has been followed only in North India. In South India, they had different practices, as shown in the list of solar month-names (Table No. 16). 

In North India the first month is Vaisakha as laid down in the S.S. which starts just after sun's passage through the V.E. point. 

It is interesting to see that in Tamil Nad, some of the names are of Sanskritic origin, others are of Tamil origin. But the most siriking fact is that the first month, starting after vernat equinox is not Vaiśākha as in the 

The Starting Day of the Solar Year In the Vedic age, the year-beginning was related "probably to one of the cardinal days of the year, but we do not know which cardinal day it was. The Vedānga Jyotiṣa started the year from the winter solstice day, Brāhmaṇas started the year from the Indian Spring (Vasarthe phen the tropical (Sāyana) "longitude of the sun amounted to 330°. 

The Siddhāntic astronomers must have found a confusion, and so fixed up a rule for fixing the year. beginning, which we have just now dicussed. These rules amount to :

In Tinnevelley and Malayalam districts the solar , months are named after the signs of the zodiac. 

There is, therefore, no uniformity of practice in the nomenclature of the solar months, and in fixing up the name of the first month of the solar year. 

Solar Months : Definition: 

After having defined the solar year, and the year beginning, the Surya Siddhānta proceeds to define the "Solar Month." 

Surya Siddhānta, Chap. 1,13 Aindavastitþibbi-stadyat samkrāntyā saura' ucyate Māsairdvādaśabhirvarṣam divyam tada harucyate. 

Translation : A lunar month, of as many lunar days (titha) ; a solar (saura) month is determined by the entrance of the sun into a sign of the zodiac, i.e. the length of the month is the time taken by the sun in passing 30° of its orbit, beginning from the initial point of a sign ; twelve months make a year, this is called a day or the gods. 

This definiton is accepted by the Ārya, and Brahma Siddhāntas as well. 

The working of this rule gives rise to plenty of difficulties, which are described below : 

The mean length of a solar month 

= 30.43823 according to S.S. 

= 30.43685 according to modern data. 

The actual lengths of the different solar months, however, differ widely from the above mean values. This is due to the fact that the earth does not move with uniform motion in a circular orbit round the sun, but moves in an elliptic orbit, one focus of which is occupied by the sun, and according to Kepler's second law, it sweeps over equal areas round the sun in equal intervals of time. When the earth is farthest from the sun, i.e. at aphelion (sun at apogee) of the elliptic orbit, the actual velocity of the earth becomes slowest, and the apparent angular velocity of the sun becomes minimum, and consequently the length of the solar month is greatest. This happens about 3rd or. 4th July, i.e., about the middle of the solar month of Aṣadha (Mithuna), and consequently this month has got the greatest length. The circumstances become reversed six months later on about 2nd or 3rd January, when the earth is nearest to the sun, i.e., at perihelion (sun at perigee), the angular velocity of the 

sun at that time becomes maximum, and consequently 

· the solar month of Pausa (Dhanuḥ) which is 

opposite to Aṣadha, has got the minimum length. The following two figures ( Nos. 25 & 26 ) will explain the position. 

The durations of the different months, which are different from each other due to the above reason, are also not fixed for all time. The durations of the solar

made up of the precessional velocity of 50,"27 per year in the retrograde direction and the perihelion velocity of 11."62 per year in the direct direction due to planetary attraction. This movement of the apse line with respect to the V.E. point causes variation in the lengths of the different months. 

(ii) The second reason is that the ellipticity of the earth's orbit is not constant ; it is gradually changing. At present the eccentricity of the orbit is diminishing and the elliptic orbit is tending to become circular. As a result, the greatest duration of the month is diminishing in length and the least one increasing. Similarly the lengths of other months are also undergoing variation.

The modern elliptic theory of planetary orbits was Fig. 25 

not known to the makers of Indian Siddhāntas, but 

they knew that the sun's true motion was far (i) the line of apsides of the earth's elliptic orbit 

from uniform. They conceived that the sun has (i.e., the aphelion and perihelion points) is not fixed 

uniform motion in a circle, with the earth not exactly at the centre of that circle, but at a small distance from it. The orbit therefore becomes an eccentric circle or an epicycle. Here also the .angular motion of the sun becomes minimum when at apogee or farthest from the earth, and maximum when 

nearest to the earth or at perigee. In this case the po frio)--- ----------44)-------- 

size and eccentricity of the circle are invariable quantities, and consequently the maximum and minimum limits of the months are constant. The apse line advances in this case also, but with a very slow motion, which according to the Surya Siddhānta 

amounts to a degree of arc in 31,008 years, or 11" in a Fig. 26 

century. The variations of the durations of months 

due to this slow motion of the apse line is quite in space but is advancing along the ecliptic at the negligible and the lengths of the months according to rate of 61".89 per year or 1.°72 per century. This is the Sūrya Siddhānta are practically constant over ages.

In the Sūrya Siddhānta, a formula is given for finding the true longitude of the sun from its mean longitude. As the length of a month is the time taken by the sun to traverse arcs of 30° each along the ecliptic by its true motion, the lengths of the different months can be worked out when its true longitudes on different dates of the year are known. The true longitude is obtained by the Sūrya Siddhānta with the help of the following formula : 

True Long. - Mean Long.–133.'68 sin K 

+3.'18 sina K where K=Mandakendra of the sun, 

3.e., - mean sun-sun's apogee. 

Different convontions for fixing up the 

beginning of the solar month The samkranti oi ingress of the sun into the different signs may take place at any hour of the day. Astronomically speaking the month starts from that moment. But for civil purposes, the month should start from a sunrise ; it should therefore start either on the day of the saṁkrānti or the next following day according to the convention adopted for the locality. There are four different conventions in different States of India for determining the beginning of the civil month. 

Rules of Samkranti 

At the approximate time of each saṁkrānti, the true longitude of the sun is calculated by the above formula for two successive days, one before the attainment of the desired multiple of 30° of longitude and the other after it, and then the actual time of crossing the exact multiple of 30th degree is obtained by the rule of simple proportion. This is called the time of saṁkrānti or solar transit. The time interval between the two successive saṁkrāntis is the actual length of the month, The lengths of the months thus derived from the Sūrya Siddhānta compared with the modern values, s.c., the values which we get after taking the elliptic motion of the sun, and the shift of the first point of Aries are shown in Table No. 17, on p. 243, in which : 

Column (1) gives the names of months. 

... (2) gives the arc measured from the first 

point of Aries (the V.E. point) covered by the true longitude 

of the sun. (3) gives the lengths of the months 

derived from the Sūrya 

Siddhānta rules. (4) gives the correct lengths of the 

months as in 1950 A.D. (5) gives the corresponding names of the 

months as proposed by the Committee.. 

The Bengal rule : In Bengal, when a samkrānt: takes place between sunrise and midnight of a civil day, the solar month begins on the following day; and when it occurs after midnight, the month begins on the next following day, i.e., on the third day. This is the general rule ; but if the saṁkrānti occurs in the period between 24 minutes before midnight to 24 minutes after midnight, then the duration of tithi current at sunrise will have to be examined. If the tithi at sunrise extends up to the moment of saṁkrānti, the month begins on the next day : if the tithi ends before sainkrānti, the month begins on the next following or the third day. But in case of Karkata and Makara samkrantes, the criterion of tithi is not to be considered. If the Karkata saṁkrānti falls in the above period of 48 minutes about the midnight, the month begins on the next day, and if the Makara sankranti falls in that period, the month begins on the third day. 

The Orissa rule : In Orissa the solar months of the Amli and Vilayati eras begin civilly on the same day (sunrise to next sunrise) as the saṁkrānti, irrespective of whether this takes place before or after midnight.. 

The Tamil rule : In the Tamil districts the rule is that when a saṁkrānti takes place before sunset, the month begins on the same day, while if it takes place after sunset the month begins on the following day.. 

The Malabar rule: The rule observed in the North and South-Malayalam country is that, if the samkranti takes place between sunrise and 18 ghaṭikās 17h 12) or more correctly fth of the duration of day from sunrise (about 1-12 P.M.) the month begins on the same day, otherwise it begins on the following day. 

It will be observed that as a result of the different conventions combined with the incorrect month lengths of the Sarya Siddhānta we are faced with the following problems 

It would appear from table No. 17 that the lengths of the months of the Sūrya Siddhānta are no longer correct; they greatly differ from their corres ponding modern vāliin sometimes by as much as 111 hours. The Surya Siddhānta values, which the almanac makers still use, are therefore grossly incorrect. Moreover, the lengths of the months are undergoing gradual variation with times due to reasons already explained.

245 : 

... (1) the civil day of the solar month-beginning 

may differ by 1 to 2 days in different parts of India. 

(2) The integral number of days of the different solar months also vary from 29 to 32. 

The mouths of Kārtika, Agrahāyana, Pauṣa, Māgha and Phālguna contain 29 or 30 days each, of which two months must be of 29 days, and others of 30 days. The months Caitra, Vaisakha and Asvina contain 30 or 31 days. 

The rest, viz., Jyaiṣtha, Āṣādha, Śrāvana and Bhadra have got 31 to 32 days each, of which one or two months will contain 32 days every year. 

(3) The length of the month by integral number. of civil days is not fixed, it varies from year to year. 

from such rules vary from 29 to 32, which is very inconvenient from various aspects of civil life. 

The Committee has therefore felt that there is no need for keeping the solar months as astronomically defined. The length of 30 and 31 days are quite enough. for civil purposes. Moreover, fixed durations of months by integral number of days is the most convenient system in calendar making. The five months from the second to the sixth have the lengths of over 30 days, and so their lengths have been rounded to 31 days each ; and to the remaining months 30 days have been allotted. 

6.7 THE LUNAR CALENDAR IN THE Siddhānta 

: JYOTISHA PERIOD. 

Justification of the Solar Calendar as proposed 

by the Committee It has been shown that the intention of the maker of Sarya Siddhānta and of other Siddhāntas was to start the year from the moment of sun's crossing the vernal equinoctial point and to start the civil year from the day following. The Committee has also adopted this view and proposed that the civil year for all-India use should start from the day following the V. E. day, i.e., from March 22. In the Vedic literature also it is found that the starting of the year was related with one or other of the cardinal days of the year. The Vedanga Jyotiṣa started the year from the winter solstice day, the Brāhmaṇas started the year from the Indian spring (Vasanta) when the tropical (Sayana) longitude of the sun amounted to 330°, but in the Siddhāntic period the year-beginning coincided with the V. E. day. So in adopting the Sāyana system in our calendar calculations, the Indian tradition, from the Vedic times up to the Siddhāntic times, has been very faithfully observed. This has ensured that the Indian seasons would occupy permanent places in the calendar. . 

As regards the number of days. per month, although the Surya Siddhānta defines only the astronomical: solar month as the time taken by the sun to traverse 30° of arc of the ecliptic, four different conventions have been evolved in different States of India for determining the first day of the civil month from the actual time of transit as narrated earlier. None of the conventions is perfect. Such rules do not yield fixed number of days for a month, as a result of which it becomes extremely difficult for a chrono logist to locate any given date of this calendar, unambiguously, in the Gregorian calendar, without going through lengthy and laborious calculations. Moreover, the number of days of months obtained 

The broad divisions of the year into seasons or months are obtained by the solar calendar, but since for religious and social puposes the lunar calendar had been used in India from the Vedic times, it becomes incumbent to devise methods for pegging on the lunar calendar to the solar. 

· The extent to which the lunar calendar affects. Indian socio-religious life will be apparent from the tables of holidays we have given on pp. 117-154. There the religious and social ceremonies and observances and holidays of all states and communities are classified under the headings :: 

(1) Regulated by the solar calendar of the Siddhāntas; 

(2) Regulated by Gregorian dates ; (3) Regulated by the lunar calendar. 

The tables show that by far the largest number of religious holidays and other important social ceremonies are regulated by the lunar calendar. It is difficult to see how the lunar affiliation, inconvenient as it is, can be replaced altogether, short of a revolution in which we break entirely with our past. The lunar calendar will therefore continue to play a very important part as we continue to keep our connection with the past, and with our cherished traditions. 

Let us now restate the problems which arise when, with reference to India, we want to peg the lunar calendar to the solar, how it was tackled in the past, and how the Calendar Reform Committee wants to tackle it. 

The lunar month consists of 29.5306 days and 12 such lunar months fall short of the solar year by 10.88 days. After about 2 or 3 years one additional or inter calary lunar month is therefore necessary to make up the year; and in 19 years there are 7 such intercalary months. In Babylon and Greece there were fixed rules 

246 

have been introduced. Taking the mean vaules of the lunation-period and of the length of the solaryear, the time when one extra month (i.e., intercalary month) will have to be introduced can easily be determined. But the luminaries do not move with uniform angular motions (throughout their period of revolution and so the determination af the intercalary month on the basis of the actual movement of the sun and the moon is a very difficult problem. The calculations according to the mean motions are however shown below. 

Table 18– Calculation of intercalary months in a 

19-year cycle. 

for intercalation ; the intercalary months appeared at stated intervals and were placed at fixed positions in 

the calendar (vide 8 3.2). It appears that some kind of 

· rough rules of intercalation of lunar months were 

followed in India up to the first or second century A.D. when the calendar was framed according to the rules of Vedānga Jyotéṣa (vide § 5.4). Thereafter the Siddhāntic system of calendar-making began to develop, replacing the old Vedānga calendar. 

The Vedanga calendar as we have seen was crude and was based on approximate values of the lunar and solar periods, the calendar was framed on the mean motions of the luminaries, and as such an intercalary month was inserted regularly after every period of 

30 months. 

The Siddhānta Jyotiṣa introduced the idea of true positions of the luminaries as distinct from their mean positions, and devised rules for framing the calendar on the basis of the true positions, and adopted more correct values for the periods of the moon and the sun. But some time elapsed before new rules were adopted, and intercalary months. continued to be calculated on the basis of the mean motions of the sun and the moon, employing however more correct values of their periods as given by the Siddhāntas. In this connection the following remarks by Sewell and Dikṣit, in the Indian Calendar (p. 27) are worth noting. 

"It must be noted with regard to the intercalation and suppression of months, that whereas at present these are regulated by the sun's and moon's apparent motion,-in other words, by the apparent length of the solar and lunar months ---and though this practice has been in use at least from 1100 A.D. and was followed by Bhāskarācārya, there is evidence to show that in earlier times they were regulated by the mean length of months. It was at the time of the celebrated astronomer Srīpati (1039 A.D.) that the change of practice took place".

It would appear from the above figures that the 19-year cycle with 7 mala māsas is a better approxi mation if we adopt the tropical year, and the error gradually, increases with the sidereal year and the Surya Siddhānta year. In 11} cycles, i.e., in 220 years, the discrepancy would amount to only a day in the case of the tropical year. 

It is also seen that one intercalary month is to be added at intervals of 327 solar months, or in other words an intercalary month recurs alternately after 32 and 33 solar months. According to this scheme the intercalary months in a period of 19 years would be as follows:

Intercalary months or Malamasas. The length of the Surya Siddhānta year is 365.258756 days, and of a lunar month according to the S. S. is. 29.5305879 days. Twelve such lunar months fall short of the S. S. year by 10.891701 days. The lunar year therefore slides back on the solar scale each year by about 11 days. If the months were allowed to slide back continuously it would have completed the cycle in 33.5355 years, and the festivals attached to the lunar calendar would have moved through all the seasons of the year within this period, as now happens with the Islamic calendar.

INDIAN CALENDAR 

247 

But the makers of Indian calendars have not ; followed any scheme for intercalation based on mean motions. They evolved a plan for distinguishing an intercalary month from a normal month based on the true motions of the sun and the moon. This plan is. also followed in giving the name to a lunar month, as explained below : 

Siddhāntic rules for the Lunar Calendar There are two kinds of lunar months used in India, the new-moon ending and the full-moon ending. In calendarical calculations only the new-moon ending months are used. 

(i) The new-moon ending lunar month covers the period from one new-moon to the next. This is known as amanta or mukhya candra māsa. It gets the same name as the solar month in which the moment of initial new-moon of the month falls. For this purpose the solar month is to be reckoned from the exact moment of one saṁkrānti of the sun to the moment of the next sankranti. When a solar month completely covers a lunar month, i.e., when there are two moments of "new-moon (amānta), one at the beginning and the other 

at the end of a solar month, then the lunar month beginning from the first new-moon is the intercalary month, which is then called an adhika or mala māsa, and the lunar month beginning from the second new moon is the normal month which is termed as śuddha or nija in the Siddhāntic system. Both the months bear the name of the same solar month but are prefixed by adhika or śuddha as the case may be. In an adhika month religious observances are not generally allowed. . If on the other hand, a lunar month completely covers a solar month, no new-moon having occurred in that solar month, the particular lunar month is then called a kṣaya or decayed month. : As the mukhya or new-moon ending lunar month begins from the Amavasyā or the new-moon occurring in the solar month bearing the same name, the lunar month may begin on any day during that solar month -it may begin on the first or even on the last day of that solar month. : ? (ii) The full-moon ending lunar month known as pūrnimānta or gauna čāndra māsa, covers the period from one full-moon to the next, and is determined on the basis of the corresponding new-moon ending month as defined above. It begins from the moment of full moon just a fort-night before the initial new-moon of an amānta month, and it also takes the name of that month, 

...But in the gaunamāna (i.es, full-moon ending lunar month), as the month starts 15 days earlier than the 

new-moon ending month, it may begin on any day during the last half of the preceding solar month and the first half of the solar month in question. It will therefore be seen that wbile the new-moon ending or mukhya month sometimes falls almost entirely out side (i.e., after) the relative solar month, the full-moon ending or a gruna month always covers at least half of the solar month of that name. 

The months used for civil purposes in the Hindi calendar are the full-moon ending lunar months, and are sub-divided into two halves-krsna pakṣa covering the period from full-moon to new-moon and termed as vadi, and śukla pakṣa covering the period from new moon to full-moon and termed as sudi. As these months, are on the gauna māna, the vadi half of a month comes first followed by the sudi half. The last day of the year is therefore a full-moon day, the Phalguni (or Holi ) Purnima, in keeping with the ancient Indian custom. 

The Samvat and śaka years in the Hindi calendar begins with Caitra śukla Pratipad. For astronomical purposes, however, the year begins a few days later with the entrance of the sun into Meṣa. 

The calendars of Āṣādhi Samvat and Kārtiki Samvat are, on the other hand, based on the new-moon ending months, and consequently the months begin 15 days later than the months of the Caitrādi full-moon ending calendar. The Āsādhi calendar begins with Aṣādha śukla 1, and the Kārtiki calendar with Kārtika śukla 1. 

The table (No. 20 on p. 249) shows the scheme of the different calendars for the year śaka 1875 (1953-54). The year contains a māla or adhika month. 

It may be seen from the above mentioned table that in case of the light half of the month (sudi half) the month has the same name for the two systems of month-reckonings, but in the dark half of the month 

(vadi half) the names of the months in the two systems are different. 

The year-beginnings of the Samvat era in the three systems of luni-solar calendar are also different, as may be seen from the following table.

RAPORT OF THE CALENDAR BEFORM COMMITTEE 

Counting of the Succession of Days, In all the calendars used in India, days are counted according to the solar reckoning, as well as according to the lunar reckoning (i.e. by tithi or lunar day). But there is a difference in emphasis. 

adhika'. For example if the third tithi is - repeated, then the sequence of days of the half-month would be 

1, 2, 3, 3 adhika, 4, etc. 

Some improvement in the use of tithi for dating purposes is, however, observed in the Fusli calendar in vogue in some parts of Northern India. In this calendar the month begins from the day following the full-moon and dates are counted consecutively from 1 to 29 or 30 without any break at new-moon, or any gapping or over-lapping of dates with kṣaya tithi or adhika tithi. In fact the dates of this calendar have no connection with tithis after the starting of the month has been determined. The year of Fusli begins after the full-moon day of lunar Bhadra 

e 

In the eastern regions (Bengal, Orissa and Assam), and in Tamil Nad and Malabar, the solar reckoning is given more prominence. The almanacs give solar months and count the days serially from 1 to 29, 30, 31 or 32 as the case may be. · The tithi endings are given for every day, and the tithi may start at any moment of the day. 

In other parts of India (except Bengal, Orissa, Assam and Tamil Nad), the counting of days is based on the lunar reckoning, and the number of the tithi current at sunrise is used as the ordinal number of the date necessary in civil affairs. So there are 29 or 30 days in a month, but the days are not always counted serially from 1 to 29 or 30. 

The month in the lunar calendar is divided into two half-months, the sudi and vadi halves in the new moon ending system, and the radi and sudi halves in the full-moon ending system. In fact the year is divided into 24 half-months instead of 12 months. So there are 14 to 15 days in a half-month (vide Table 20). 

The tithi or lunar day. is measured by the positions of the moon and the sun. When they are in conjunc tion, i.e., at new-moon the 30th tithi or amāvasyā ends and the first tithi starts which continues upto the moment when the moon gains on the sun by 12° in longitude. Similarly when the difference between the moon and the sun is 24o the second tithi ends, and so on. The average duration of a tithi is 236 37.m6, but the actual duration of a particular tithi undergoes wide variations from the above average according to the different positions of the sun, the moon and the lines of their apsides. . It may become as great as 266 47m and as small as 19h.59m. So generally to every day there is a tithi. But sometimes a tithi begins and ends on the same civil day, and such a tithi is dropped ; and some religious ceremonies of auspicious character are not allowed to take place on such a tithi, and the following day begins with the next following tithi. For example, if the third tithi is dropped, the sequence of days of the half-month is 1, 2, 4, 5 etc., thus the serialitas broken here. 

As opposed to the above-mentioned case, the tithi sometimes extends over two days, there being no tithi ending in a day (from sunrise to next sunrise). As the same tithi remains current on two successive sunrises, the same tithi-number is allotted to both the days ; In the second day, however, it is suffised by the term 

Mala Masa and Købaya Masa It has been stated befcre that even at the beginning of the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa period, the intercalary months (mala or adhika) were determined on the basis of the mean motions of the sun and the moon, and as such there was no possibility of the occurrence of any so called kṣaya or decayed month. But as already mentioned, from about 1100 A.D., the intercalary months are being determined on the basis of the true motions of the luminaries, s.e., on the actual lengths of the new-moon-ending lunar month and of the different solar months as obtained from Siddhāntic rules. This gave rise to the occurrence of kṣaya months, and the intercalary months were also placed at very irregular intervals. 

The period from new-moon to new-moon (the lunar month ) is not a period of fixed duration ; it varies within certain limits according to the different positions of the apse line of the lunar and solar orbits, as follows :

Comparing these values with the actual lengths of solar months given in Table 24, it is observed that the minimum length of the lunar month falls short of all the solar months, even of the shortest month of Pausa. But as a mala māsa is not possible in that month, the maximum and minimum limits of the lunar months are recalculated for each of the solar months from Kartika to Phālguna separately, INDIAN CALENDAR

Comparing the above limits with the actual leagths of months stated before, it is found that the minimum length of the lunar month falls short of all the solar months except Pauṣa. So a malamasa or intercalary month is possible in all the months. except the mouth! of Pausa only.

The maximum duration of a lunar month, on the other hand, exceeds the lengths of the solar months only in case of solar Agrahāyanan Pausa and Māgha. So a kṣaya month is possible only in these three months. 

A list is given below showing the actual intercalary months occurring during the period śaka 1823 (1901-2 A. D.) to śaka 1918 (1996-97 A. D.) on the basis of Sūrya Siddhānta calculations.

According to the Siddhāntic rules, the lunar calendar is pegged on to the solar calendar, and so it is the luni-solar calendar with which we are at present concerned. It has already been shown that the length of the Sūrya Siddhānta year is greater than the year of the seasons (i.e., the tropical year) by about 24 minutes. As a result of this the seasons have

REPORT OF THE CALENDAR REFORM COMMITEE 

The apparent antiquity of certain eras, ė.g., the Kaliyuga or the Saptarsi, are however rather deceptive," for these eras are not mentioned either in the Vedic literature or even in the Mahābhārata ( a work of the 4th to 2nd century B.C.). The best proof, however, that no eras were used in date-recording in ancient India is obtained from "Inscriptions" which give 'con temporary evidence of the method of date-recording in use at the time when the inscription was composed. 

In India, the oldest inscriptions so far discovered and deciphered satisfactorily are those of the Emperor Asoka (273 to 227 B.C.); for the earlier Indus valley seal recordings have not yet been deciphered and no inscriptions or seals which can be referred to the time period between 2500 B.C. (time of Indus valley civili zation) and 250 B.C. ( time of Asoka ) have yet been brought to light. Asoka mentions in his inscriptions only the number of years elapsed since his coronation. No month, week-day or the serial number of the day in the month is mentioned. A typical Asokan ins cription giving time references is given in § 5.5. 

Continuous eras first began to be used in the re cords of the Indo-Scythian kings who reigned in modern Afghanistan and North-Western India beta ween 100 B.C. to 100 A.D. 

What is then the origin of the Kaliyuga or Saptarsi era given in Table 27 which go back to thousands of years before Christ? We are going to show presently that they are extrapolated eras invented much later than the alleged starting year. 

It is clear from historical records that date-recor ding by an era in India started from the time of the Kuṣana emperors and śaka satraps of Ujjain. But India cannot be singled out in this respect, for none of the great nations of antiquity, vix., Egypt, Babylon, Assyria or later Greece and Rome, used a continuously running era till rather late in their history. The introduction of the era is connected with the develop ment of the sense of 'History' which came rather late to all civilized nations. 

centuries in the total period of the cycle. Each cen tury is named after a naksatra, viz., Afrint, Bharani, etc ; and the number of years within the century is generally mentioned, so that the number of year of the era never exceeds 100. This era was in use in Kashmir and neighbouring places. In fact this era has no relation with the seven Rsis (the Great Bear) in the sky or with any actual naksatra division. There is difference of opinion as to the beginning of the era. According to Vrddha Garga and the Puranas the. starting year of the tenth century named after Magha are 3177 B.C., 477 B.C. and 2224 A.D. of the different cycles, when according to Varahamihira the third century named Krttikā begins. The beginning years of Varahamihira's Magha century of the different cycles are however 2477 B. C., 224 A. D. and 2924 A.D. 

The Pandava Kala or the Yudhisthira era started from 2449 B.C. according to Varahamihira. 

The so-called Yudhisthira era (2449 B.C.) is given by Kalhana, chronicler of Kashmir (1150 A.D.), who quotes the date from VỊddha Garga, an astronomer whose time is unknown. This era also does not occur in any inscription or any ancient treatise prior to Kalhana (1150 A.D.). Prof. M. N. Saha has shown that in the Mahābhārata the Krttikās are in many places taken as the first of the nakṣatras and are very nearly coincident with the vernal equinox. If we calculate the date of the M.Bh. incidents on this basis, the date comes out to be very nearly 2449 B.C. - 

It, however, niether proves that the incidents mentioned in the M.Bh., if they were actual occurrences, took place in 2449 B.C., for the epic was, not certainly put to writing before 400 B.C. as we know from a verse already mentioned on p. 226. It is inconceiveable to think that the dates could be remembered correctly for over 2000 years, when writing was in a very primitive state. The astro nomical references in the battle scenes, from which certain writers very laboriously deduce the date of these occurrences, are most probably later interpola tions, on the supposition that the incidents occurred about 2449 B.C. There is no inscriptional record regarding the use of Yudhiṣthira era or Pandavakāla.

Critical Examination of Indian Eras 

Here we are examining critically the claims of a few eras, which was supposed to date much earlier, e.g., the Kaliyuga era whico is commonly believed to have been introduced in 3102 B.C., the Saptarsi era, and the Pandara-Kala mentioned by Kalhana, the historian of Kashmir, who wrote in 1150 A.D., and supposed to be dating from 2449 B.C., and others. 

The Saptarsi era commoly known as Lokakalá or Laukika Kala is measured by centuries and has 27 sach 

(a) The Kaliyuga Era 

· It is easy to show that the Kaliyuga era which purports to date from 3102 B.C. is really an extra polated: era just like the Christian era, introduced long long after the supposed year of its beginning. 

It is first mentioned by Aiyabbata, the great i stronomer of ancient Påtaliputra, who says that'.3600 

INDIAN QALENDAR 

years of the Kaliyuga had passed .when he was 23 years old which is śaka year 421 (499 A. D.). It is not mentioned earlier either in books or in inscriptions. 

The first mention of this era in an inscription is found in the year 634-35 A.D., the inscription being that of king Pulakesin II of the Calukya. dynasty of Badam!, or somewhat earlier in a Jain treatise. It was most probably an era invented on astrological grounds just like the era of Nabonassar, by Aryabhaṭa or some other astropomer, who felt that the great antiquity of Indian civilization could not be described by the eras then in use (śaka, Chedi or Gupta era), as they were too recent. 

What were these astrological grounds ? The astrological grounds were that at the beginning of the Kaliyuga, the sun, the moon and the planets were in one zodiacal sign near the fixed Siddhāntic Meṣadi which according to some authorities is Ś Piscium, but according to others is 180° from Citrā or a Virginis. This was probably a back calculation based on the then prevailing knowledge of planetary motion, but has now been found to be totally wrong, when recalculated with the aid of more accurate modern data on planetary motion. We quote from 

Ancient Indian Chronology, pp. 35-39 by Prof. P. C. Sengupta, who has given a full exposition of Burgess's views on this point, with recalculations of his own. 

should also be a total eclipse of the Sun ; but no such things happened at that time. The beginning of the Kaliyuga was the midnight at Ujjayini terminating the 17th February of 9102 B.O., &ccording to Sūrya Siddhānta and the ārdharātrika system of Aryabhaṭa's astronomy as described in the Khandakhādyaka of Brahmagupta. Again this Kaliyuga is said to have begun, according to the Aryabhaṭīya from the sunrise at Lankā (supposed to be on the equator and on the same meridian with Ujjain)—from the mean sunrise on the 18th Feb., 3102 B.O. . 

Now astronomical events of the type described above and more specially the conjunction of the sun and the moon 

cannot happen both at midnight and at the next mean : sunrise. This shows that this Kaliyuga had an upreal 

beginning. . The researches of Bailey, Bentley and Burgess have : shown that a conjunction of all the 'planets' did not happen at the beginning of this Kaliyuga. Burgess rightly observes : 'It seems hardly to admit of a doubt that the epoch (the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyuga) was arrived at by astronomical calculation carried backward. 

We also can corroborate the findings of above research e rs in the following way and by using the most up-to-date

"Astronomical Kaliyuga an Astronomical Fiction" 

At the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyuga, all the mean places of the planets, viz., the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and tuturn, are taken to have been in conjunction at the beginning of the Hindu sphere, the moon's apogee and her ascending node at respectively a quarter circle and a half circle ahead of the same intial point. Under such a conjunction of all the planets, there 

added 49° 32' 39" to these mean tropical longitudes arrived at from the rules used, so as to get the longitudes measured from the vernal equinox of Aryabhạta's time. 

Hence we see that the assumed positions of the mean planets at the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyugá were really incorrect and the assumption was not a reality. But of what use this assumption was in Aryabhaṭa's time, i.e., 499 A.D., is now set forth below.' 

254 

Aryabhaṭa says that when he was 23 years old, 3600 years of. Kali bad elapsed. According to his Ārdharātrika system: 

3600 years - 1/1200 of a Mahāyuga=1314931.5 days. Again according to his Audayika system :. 

3600 years=1/1200 of a Mabāyuga=1314931.25 days. 

Honce according to both these systems of astronomy of Aryabhaṭa, by counting 3600 years from the beginning of the astronomical Kali epoch, we arrive at the date March 21, 499 A.D., Ujjayini mean time, 12 noon. The unreality of the Kali epoch is also evident from this finding. However, the position of mean planets at this time work out an given in table 26 below. 

about 57 B. C. Moreover a critical examination of inscriptions show the following details about this era. 

The earliest mention of this era, where it is definitely connected with the name of king Vikrakoso ditya is found in an inscription of one king Jaikadeva who ruled near Okhamandal in the Kathiawar Statêi The year mentioned is 794 of Vikrama era, i.e., 737 A.D.' In a subsequent inscription, dated 795 V.E. it : is also called the era of the lords of Malava. So the Vikrama era and the era of Malava lords are one and the same. Tracing back, we find the Malavagana era in use by a family of kings reigning at Mandasor, Rajputana between the years 461-589 V.E., as feuda

For Unfortunately no historical documents or inscrip a time, Northern India used the Harsa : era introdu ions have yet been discovered showing clearly the ced by the emperor Harsa Vardhana (606 A.D.), but xistence of a king Vikramaditya reigning at Ujjain when the Gurjara-Pratihars, who came from 

INDIAN CALENDAR 

Rajasthan, conquered the city of Kanauj about 828 A.D., they brought the Vikrama era from their original home, and it became the current era all over northern India except the eastern region, and was used by all Rajput dynasties of medieval times. . 

The months of the Vikrama era are all lunar, and the first month is Caitra. The months begin after the full-moon but the year begins 15 days after the full moon of Phalguna, i.e. after the new-moon of Caitra. But for astronomical calculations, it is pegged on to a solar year, which starts on the first of solar Vaisakha, theoretically the day after the vernal equinox. The Vikrama era is current also in parts of Gujrat, but there the year begins in Kārtika and the months are amānta, which corresponds to the Macedonian month of Dios, and the epoch is just six months later. Thus the western and northern varieties of the Vikrama era follow respectively the Macedonian and Babylonian reckonings (see § 3.3), the year of starting is 255 years later than that of the Seleucidean era. 

The conclusion is that the champions of the Vikrama era have still to prove the existence of king Vikrama of Ujjain. Early inscriptions show that the method of date-retording is not typically Indian as in the Satavahana inscriptions but follow the śaka-Kuṣāṇa method, which follows the contemporary . Graeco Chaldean method. It was therefore a foreign recko ning introduced either by the Greeks or Sakas, or an Indian prince or tribe who had imbibed some Graeco-Chaldean culture, but was adopted by the Malava tribes who migrated from the Punjab to Rajas than about the first century B.C. . The association with a king Vikrama occured 800 years later, and is probably due to lapse of historical memory, for the only historical king Vikramaditya who is known to have crushed the śaka power in Ujjain, was king Candragupta II of the Gupta dynasty (about 395 A.D.). Before this, the śaka dynasty in Ujjain had reigned almost in unbroken sequence from about 100 A.D. to 395 A.D., and had used an era of their own, later known as the "śaka' era. All the Gupta emperors from Samudragupta, had an "Aditya" title, and many of them had the title "Vikramaditya" so that the Gupta age was par excellence the age of Vikramadityas. But all the Gupta emperors use in their inscriptions the family era called the Guptakala which commemorated the foundation of Gupta empire (319 A.B). The association of the Malava era with king Vikramaditya, and assignment of king Vikramaditya to Ujjain, was due to confusion of historical memory not infrequent in Indian history. It may be mentioned that the Vikrama era is never used by Indian astro nomers for their calendaric calculations, for which puapose the śaka era is exclusively used. 

(e) Tho śaka Bra The śaka Era is the era par excellence which has been used by Indian astronomers all over India in their calculations since the time of the astronomer Varaha mihira (died 587 A.D.) and probably earlier. The Indian almanac-makers, even now, use the śaka era for calculations, and then convert the calculations to their own systems. 

This era is extensively used over the whole of India except in Tinnevelly and part of Malabar, and is more widely used than any otber era. It is also called śaka Kala, śaka Bhapa Kala, Sakendra Kala, and Salivabana śaka and also śaka Samvat. Its years are Caitrādi for luni-solar reckoning and Meṣādi for solar reckoning. In the luni-solar reckoning the months are pūrnimântā in the North and amāntā in Southern India. The reckoning of the śaka era begins with the vernal equi nox of 78 A.D., and is measured by expired years, so the year between the vernal equinox of 78 A.D. to that of 79 A.D. is zero of śaka era. In some pañcāṅgais of Southern India the current year is however seen to be used instead of the elapsed year, where the number of year of the era is one more than the era in general use 

But we are not yet sure about the origin of this era. It has been traced back to the śaka satraps of Ujjain, from the year 52 (130 A.D.) to the end of the dynasty about 395 A.D. But in their own records, they merely record it as year so and so, but there is not the slightest doubt that the era used by them subsequently became known as the śaka era (ride: 5.5) 

The Old and the New śaka era. The dates given by different authorities about the starting year of the old śaka era mentioned in § 5.5 vary from 155 B.C. to-88 B.G. as given below: Konow : 88 B.C. (date of death of Mithradates II, the 

powerful Parthian emperor who is 

said to have subjugated the Sakas). Konow has proposed a number of other dates. Jayaswal : 120 B.C. : Herzfeld : 110 B.C. : Settlement of the Sakas in 

..Seistan by Mithradates II. Rapson : 150 B.C. : Establishment of the śaka 

kingdom of Seistan. Tarn : 155 B.C. : Date of settlement of the śaka 

immigrants in Seistan by 

Mithradates I. Recently Dr. Van Lohuizen de Leeuw has discus sed the starting point of this era in her thought-provok ing book The Scythian Period of Indian History'. She bas Tejected all the above dates, and fixed up 129 B.C. as the starting date of the old śaka era. She identifies this year as the one in which the Śakas, descending from the Trans-Oxus region, attacked the Parthian empir

in which the Parthian emperor Phraates II was defea- ted and killed, and the rich. province of Bactria was occupied by the Sakas. They founded an era to com memorate their victory over the Parthians which their successors took to India, as they expanded and put an end to the Bactrian Greek principalities in Afghanistan and north-west Punjab. She suggests that the old Śaka era was also used by the Kuṣanas, who were after all a Sakish ruling tribe, but from the time of Kaniska with hundreds omitted. 

Dr. M. N. Saba has supported this theory in its main features, but he thinks that the era was founded in 123 B.C., for he shows from historical records that the Sakas assailed Bactria first in 129 B.C. and entered into a seven year conflict with the Parthians, and finally. conquered Bactria in 123 B.C., when the Par thian' emperor Artabanus II, was defeated and killed. Probably the Sakas then founded their era. This was also called the era of Azes. Dr. Van Lohuizen, de Leeuw has accepted Saha's suggestion. 

This hypothesis, though not finally settled appears to, have a good deal of probability, for the following reasons : . 

The points given in § 5.5 and above may be summarized as follows: 

(a) The Sakas starting from Central Asia attacked the Parthian empire in 129: B.C., and overcame Parthian resistance by 123 B.C. : It is very probable that they started an era to commemorate their accession to power in Bactria from 123 B.C. They used Macedonian months and Graeco-Chaldean methods of calendaric. calculations as prevalent in the Seleucid and Parthian dominions, Probably the era was some times named after Azes, who was probably their leader. But this Azes is not to be confounded with later Azes I or Azes II, who reigned in Taxila between 40 B.C. and 20 B.C. Within the first 200 years of its starting, the era was alternatively called the Azes era, 

(b) This śaka era ( known to archaeologists as the old Śaka era ) was used by the śaka emperors and śaka satraps in their Indian territories, but the time reckoning began to be gradually influenced by Indian customs. They began to use Indian months alter natively with Macedonian months and Parnimānta months in place of Amanta months. During the first 200 years, the hundreds were sometimes omitted, in the use of the era. : (c) The so-called Kaniska era is nothing but the old śaka era with 200 omitted. 

(d) The Śaka era was used by the house of Castana of Ujjain with 200 omitted, but gradually they forgot the origin of the era and continued their own reckoning without further omission of hundreds upto the end of the śaka satrapal rule over Ujjaini about 395 A.D. As the early Indian astronomers were mostly of foreign origin (viz. Sakadvipi Brahmana) the astronomical reckonings necessary for compiling the calendar were carried out using the śaka era and Graeco-Chaldean astronomy. The blending of Graeco-Chaldean astronomy as known about the early years of the Christian era with older Indian calendarical features formed the basis of Siddhānta Jyotiṣa. The Sakadvipi Brahmins also brought to India horoscopic astrology using the śaka era exclusively in horoscopes, a custom which has persisted to this day. These facts explain the pre-eminence of the śaka era. 

Dr. Saha points to the fact that Indian classics, which can be dated from the third century B.C. to the second century A.D., mentions three' races in what is modern Afghanistan and N. W. India, viz., the Sakas, the Yavanas, and the Pallavas, who attained to the status of ruling races. The order in which they are mentioned denotes correct chronological sequence, for they are arranged in the order of their chronological appearance in history, the Sakas being mentioned as a subject race in Darius's inscription (518 B.C.). But the Yavanas (Greeks) were the first to attain the status of a ruling race, from 312 B.C., the date of foundation of the Seleucid empire, whose power in the west was overthrown by the Parthians, or Pehlevis (Pallayas of Indian classics) in 248 B.C. 

(d) Other Eras 

Both these ruling races of Yavanas and Pallavas used eras of their own, viz., the Seleucidean era from 312 B.C., and the Parthian era from 248 B.C. Did the third race, viz., the Sakas who were the last to attain status of a ruling race ever use an era of their own ? It would be surprising if they did not, for it became the fashion for all races, who attained the status of ruting people, to have eras of their own. The early Sakas, -as their records stroge were deeply influenced by their neighbours to the west, viz., the Parthians who adopted Greek culture, and their coin-records show that they also adopted Greek culture, and therefore most probably, the Graeco-Chaldean method of date recording.

After the introduction of Tarikh Nahi, the people of Bengal began to use the Sarya Siddhānta reckoning, and the solar year. The Bengali San had thus a hybrid origin; to find the current year of the Bengali San, we take Hejira year elasped in 1556, i.e., 963 and add to it the number of solar years. Thus 1954 A. D. is 963 A.D.+(1954-1556)=1361 of Bengali San. 

era = 1270 A.D. Most of the antiquarians however put the date of Nirvāna in 483 B.C. The origin of the Buddha Nirvana era used in Ceylon has not yet been satisfactorly explained. . 

The Gupta Era :--This era was clearly \established by the founder of the Gupta dynasty (Candragupta I) to commemorate the accession to imperial power of his family, about 319 A.D., and was in vogue over the whole of Northern India from Saurashtra to Bengal during the days of their hegemony (319 A.D.-550 A.D.). · After the decay of their empire, the era was continued by their former vassals, the Maitrakas of Vallabhi and was in use in parts of Guzrat and Rajputana up to the thirteenth century. Its use in Bengal was discon tinued from about 510 A.D. with the disappearance of Gupta rule first in South Bengal, then over the whole of Eastern India. In the Uttar Pradesh (ancient Madhyadeśa), it was driven out by the Harșa era, which had a short period of existence, 606-824 A.D., when the city of Kanauj was occupied by king Nagabhata of the Pratibar dynasty, who hailed from Rajasthan. The Pratibārs brought with them the Vikrama era, which had been current in Rajasthan, and this became the great era of the north, used by all medieval Rajput dynasties, except those belonging to the eastern region.

es 

Eras in Eastern India 

Most parts of Bengal were under the Gupta emperors, and used the Gupta era during their hegemony (319-510 A.D.). But Gupta rule disappeared as mentioned above from major parts of Bengal from ca. 510 A.D., and the subsequent dynasties including the Pala emperors ( 750 A.D.-1150 A.D.) used regnal years in their inscriptions for four hundred years of their rule. The śaka era in Bengal appear to have been introduced by the Sena dynasty which replaced the Palas; the Senas were migrants from the south (Karnata-Kṣatriyas ), where they were familiar with the śaka era, but it was not used in royal records which continued to use regnal years. The Vikrama Samvat never became popular in Bengal, or Eastern India. After Mohamedan conquest, Bengal was left without an era. For official purposes, Hejira was used, but the learned men used the śaka era, and the common people in certain parts used a rough reckoning, 

Other hybrid eras A number of other hybrid eras formed in a similar 

· way to Bengali San is mentioned in the table (No. 27): 

Amli and Vilayati in Bengal and Orissa, the various Fasli or harvest years in Bengal, Deccan, and Bombay. 

All the other eras mentioned as hybrid in the chart were formed in a similar way, and the slight differences are due to mistakes in calculation, or differences in the time of introduction. While the Bengali San has Meṣadi . as year-beginning, others have taken the year-beginning to be coincident with some important mythical event of local provenance, e.g., the year-beginning of the Amli era used in Orissa, viz., the 12th lunar day of the light half of the month of Bhadra is said to represent the birth date of king Indradyumna, the mythical king who is said to have discovered the site of modern Puri. The great temple of Puri was actually built by king Anyanka Bhim Dev of the Gangã dynasty about 1119 A.D., and kings of this dynasty who held sway in Orissa from 1035-1400, A. D. used the Ganga era, 

The Kollam era prevalent in the Malayalam countries is of obscure origin. The year of this era is known as the Kollam Andu. The era is also called the Era of Paraśurāma, and is said to have omitted thousands from their previous reckonings. In South Malabar it begins with the solar month Simha and in North Malabar with the solar month Kanya. The era started from 825 A.D. 

The Jovian cycle : In Southern India the years are named after the name of the Jovian year and so it also serves the purpose of an era of a short period, viz., 60 years, after which the years recur. Details about Jovian years will be found in Appendix 5-E.

The Seasons 

We have seasons because the celestial equator is oblique The amount of daylight received at any place determines to the sun's path (or the ecliptic), or in modern parlanoo, the season. When we have maximum sunlight, we have the axis of rotation of the earth is not perpendioular to its the bot season. When we have minimum sunlight, we shall orbit, but inclined at an angle of 661. This causes varying have winter. The other seasons come in-between. Bain, amounts of sunlight to fall on a particular locality through frost, etc., are secondary effects produced by varying out the year. If the earth's axis were perpendicular to the amounts of sunlight, and of the atmospherio conditions ecliptic, in other words the obliquity were zero, overy stimulated by the sunlight received. The sun is the sole portion of the earth from the equator to the pole would Srbiter of the seasons. have had 12 hours of sunlight, and- 12 hours of shade. Hence the definitions of seasons as given by the ancient There would have been no seasons on any part of the earth, astronomers, whether Western and Indian, which base them just as we have now for places on the earth's equator, whore on the cardinal days of the year, are the only correct, we have no variation of geason throughout the year, because definitions.

correctly. It is now known that they all used the gnomon. Measures of the length of the different seasons and of the year by some of their eminent astronomers are given in the table (No. 30) below. 

The Chaldeans must have also measured the length: of the year by the same method, either somewhat earlier or simultaneously with the early Greeks, but their names, excepting those of a few have not survived. But if in reality, the nineteen-year cycle was of as early as 747 B.C., they must have arrived at & correct length of the year much earlier than any other nation. 

The Length of the Seasons : The lengths of geasons were found exactly in the same way as in the case of the year, e.g., in the case of Spring, by counting the number of days from the day next to the vernal equinox day to the summer solstice day. The number would be variable from year to year, but a correct value was found by taking the observations for a number of years and taking the mean. The lengths obtained by early astronomers &re : 

the sun orossed the summer solstice (Juno 22), as is evident from the lines in Kalidasa's Meghadata or Cloud-Mogbangor.

. Winter solstice get in with the month of Tapas, which means penance. The winter solstice as mentioned above was the time from which the yearly sacrifices started. 

The month names in the last column of table (No. 29) are ‘lunar', bụt they were linked to the solar months. They are now in universal use all over India to donote solar as well as lunar months ; but the two varieties are distinguished by the adjectives 'Solar' or 'Lunar'. 

Both the European and Indian definitions of seasons are scientific as they are based on the cardinal days. The difference in nomenclature is trivial.

The ancients early discovered that the seasons were of unequal length, but they were ignorant of the physical reasons. These exact definitions of seasons, both in India and in the West, were arrived at very early, and are very important for accurate calendar-making ; but the true meaning of those definitions were forgotten in the succeed ing periods in India. 

In Europoan astronomy, which is derived from Graeco Chaldean astronomy, we have : 

Spring 0° - 90° from V.E, to 8.8. Summer 90°-180° .8. to ANE. Autumn 180°—270° A.E. to W.8. 

Winter 270°—360° • W.8. to V.E. According to this scheme, the Rainy season consisting of months of Nabhas and Nabhasya formally set in when 

The Length of the Year : The length of the year, as mentioned earlier, must have been found by counting the number of days from one equinox to another, or one solstice 'to another. 

In actual practice, the number of days of the year, counted in this way would vary between 365 and 366. In the early stages, the length of the year was whole-numbered, but Indians of Vedāng& Jyōtiṣa period had a year of: 366 days. Later when they came to a rigorous definition of the year, they realized that the number of days was not whole, but involved fractions.. Probably the attempt at determin ing the exact length of the year involving fractional numbers was obtained by adding up the lengths for & number of years, and taking the mean.

of Libra, the epooh comes out to be 286 A.D., and the. corresponding Vornal point 2° to the west of Ptolemy's. 

This analysis shows that the Indian astronomers had arrived at the idea that the equidoctial point should be properly located with reference to some standard stars and there were probably three attempts, one about 286 A.D., the next about 500 A.D., and the last one about 570. A,D. They had not accepted the first point given by Ptolemy or any western astronomer. 

The compiler (or compilers) of the S.S. was clearly anconscious of the procession of equinoxes, and while in his .. report, he made a selection of these da tau, he did not perceiro that they were inconsistent with the idea of a fixed V.E. point. 

But he did not err on the fandamental point. He had clearly laid down that Meṣādi, i.e., the first point of Aries from which the year was to be started was to be identified with the vernal equinootial point.. 

It is to be noticed that though the laker of the 8. 

B us absorbed many of the ideas from Greek astronomy including the use of technical terms like horā, liptikā, kendra, etc., ho did not either blindly copy the Graeco-Chaldean data. From whichever source he might have got the ideas. he absorbed it correctly and made an attempt to fix up the actual V.E point, as required in Chaldean astronomy, otherwise his zero-point would have been coincident with Ptolemy's. We have shown that whatever the Hindu zero-point of the zodiac might be, it is not coincident with that of Ptolemy.

Translation 1. While the celestial bodies move in the sky from north to south and again from south to north, a very small variation takes place in their doolination. 

2. The (ascending) node in which the celestial equator and the ecliptic intersect is the first point of Aries (Meṣādi), and it gives the 'Esst'. Tha second node is the first point of Libra (Tuladi), and these two points never change their declination value (which is zero). . . . 

3. The first point of Cancer (Karkadi) is at a distance of three signs (i.e. 90°) from it, and at a distance of three signs in the reverse order is the position of the first point of Capricorn (Makarādi). These give the positions of maximum declination which is 24 degrees. 

4. The solstitial points (which mark the ayanas) show a movement, and the number of their revolutions in a Kalpa is counted as 199669. 

The last passage recognizes processional motion, says that it is continuous, and gives the rate as 59".9 per year. Muñjāla Bhata makes no mention of trepidation. He noticed that the Ayanas had precessed by about 6° from the position given in the Sūrya-Siddhānta. 

Pr̥thūdaka Svāmi (born 928 A.D.), an astronomer who observed at Peibowa, near Kuruksetra, commenting on a passage of Brahmagupta says : 

"The revolution of Ayana in one Kalpa is 189411. 

This is called the Ayana Yuga". This passage recognizes the continuous nature of precessional motion, and gives the rate of precessional motion as 56".82 seconds per year. 

So far we have no mention of the 'Theory of Trepidation.' This is first mentioned in the Arya Siddhānta, ascribed to Aryabhaṭa II, whose date is 1028 A.D. It says : Ayanagrabadoh krāntijyācāpam kendravat dhanarna i syāt Ayànalavāstat samskệta khețādayana carāpamalagpāni. 12. 

Translation : -Find the sine declination (krāntijyā) of the ayanagraha (in a way similar to that of the sun's declination); from it deduce the amount of declination, plus (north) or minus (south), which is the amount of ayanāṁśa.* After applying this ayanāṁśa-correction to the planet, the values of cara (half the difference between the lengths of day and night), declination of planets, lagna (the orient ecliptic point), etc., are to be calculated. 

This has been interpreted as follows (Dikṣit, p.330). 

The equinox oscillates between #24°, and the number of rovolutions of the Ayana-planet in a Kalpa is 578159, which gives the period 8-royolution as 7472 years and the annual rate of motion as 173"4. During & quarter period viz., 1868 years, the ayananśa increases from 0° to 24°, at first, rapidly, then gradually more slowly like the increase of 

declination of the sun. Thereafter it diminishes in like manner and after the lapse of 3736 years, i.e. the half period, it again becomes zero and goes on the other side. The annual rate of motion, which on the average amounts to 46.3 seconds, varies from t 70'-5 to 0" 

Wo now come to a very controversial passage in the modern Sūrya Siddhānta, Chap. III, verses 9 to 12. 

These are : 

Trimsat kftyo yuge bhānāṁ cakram prāk parilamvate tadgunād bhūdinairbhaktāt dyaganāt yada bāpyate. 9 

Taddostrighnā daśāptāmśā vijñeyā ayanābhidhāḥ tatsamskstādgrahāt krānticchāyā caradalādikam sphutan dʻktulyatāṁ gacchedayane viguvadvaye. 10 Prāk cakram calitam hine chāyārkāt karaṇāgate antarāmsai rathāvștya pascacchegaistathādbike. 11 Evaṁ viṣuvaticchāyā svadese yā dinārdhajā daksinottara rekbāyām gā tatra viṣuvat prabhā. 12 

Translation 9. In an Age (yuga), the circle of the asterisms (bha) falls back eastward thirty score of revolutions. Of the result obtained after multiplying the sum of days (dyugana) by this number, and dividing by the number of natural days in an Age, 

10. Take the part which determines the sine, multiply it by three, and divide by ten ; thus are found the degrees called those of the precession (ayana). From the longitude of a planet as corrected by these are to be calculated the declination, shadow, ascensional difference (caradala) etc. 

11. The circle, as thus corrected, accords with its ob served place at the solstice (ayana) and at either equinox ; it has moved eastward, when the longitude of the sun, as obtain ed by calculation, is less than that derived from the shadow. 

12. By the number of degrees of the difference ; then, turning back, it has moved westward by the amount of difference, when calculated longitude is greater. 

These verses occur in the chapter on astronomical measurements by the gnomon, and are misfits there ; according to all authorities, these verses did not exist in the original Sūrya-Siddhānta, but have been extrapolated there, and have no reference to the context of the chapter. The extrapolation must, however, have taken place before the time of Bhāska rācārya II (1114-1178 A.D.), because he comments on this passage. 

The passage supports the theory of trepidation and says that the amplitude of processional oscillation is 27o and the period of one complete oscillation is stated to be 7200 years. The rate of procession is given as 54" per year, which is uniform and the same throughout the oscillation. These stanzas are quoted by Indian astrologers who are advocates of the nirayana system, in support of their arguments for sticking to the sidereal year. They say that the present ayanāṁśa is about 22°, and r. will go on precessing for another 350 years till ayanāṁśa bocomes 27o and will then turn back on its return journey. 

the This is a technical term used by Indian astronomers to denote the distance of the vernal point from the fixed Hindu Zodiac. INDIAN CALENDAR 

269 

This is sufficient argument to them to turn down all proposals for Sayana reckoning taking the length of the year to be tropical. 

We now take the opinion of the last great Indian astronomer Bhāskarācārya II (1150 A.D.). 

He uses the term 'Sampāt-Calana' i.e., movement of the intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, instead of the classical term Ayana. He says : 

Siddhānta Siromani, Goladhyāya, 

Golabandhādhikāra Tasya (viṣuvatkrāntivalayapātasya] api calanamasti. Yo'ayanacalana bhāgāḥ prasiddhāsta ova vilomagasya 

krāntipātasya bhāgāḥ Translation :--It (the equinox) 'has also movement. What is commonly known as the amount of procession (ayanām śa) is the same as the longitude of the equinoctial point measured backwards. 

This evidently shows that he regarded the change as due to the retrograde motion of the node (i.e. equinoctial point) like modern European astronomers. 

He criticises Brahmagupta for his views on Ayana Calana and says: “One can observe that at the time of Brahmagupta, the ayanāṁśa value was very small and hence it is likely that it could not have come to his notice ; yet how is it that he did not take the rate of revolution of oquinoxes as given by the Sūrya-Siddhānta, just as he has taken figures for rates in some other cases on the basis (or authority) of already proved and accepted rates". 

He further says : Ayanacalanam yaduktam Muðjālādyaiḥ sa evāyam 

(krāntipātah) tatpakṣe tadbhaganāḥ kalpe go'rgartu-nanda-go-candrāḥ 

(199669). 

Atha ca yo vā to vā bhaganāḥ bhavantu yadā yo'msa nipuṇairupa labhyante tadā sa ova krāntipātaḥ. 

Translation :-"What Muðjāla and others have mention ed as 'Ayano Calana', is nothing but the motion of this .. equinoctial point. According to their view the number of revolution in a Kalpa is 199669 (yielding annul rate of 59".9). Let whatsoever be the number of revolutions, whatever amount is obtained by expert observers is the angle of precession for that time.” 

From this it is clear that he recommends one to accept the ayandinsa which one would actually get by observation of sun's place at any particular time. Dīkṣit says : 

I have not come across single statement in which Bhāskarācārya has clearly said that equinoctial point makes a complete "circular revolution", nor does be say that "it does not make it”. 

He has taken 1 minute per year as the ayana-motion and has supposed 11° as the gyanāmśa in śaka 1105. He thus means to take Śaka 445 as the zero-precession year. 

We thus perceive that Indian astronomers up to the time of Bhāskarācārya were as much divided in their ideas about precesssion of the equinoxes as the contemporary Arab astronomers of the West (Hispano-Muslim), and the East. It is only after 1024 A.D. that they adopted a theory of trepidation. The earlier-astronomers like Muñjāla and Pșthūdaka merely noticed precession and gave their own rates for it. Bhāskarācārya is non-committal about trepidation. The Indian astronomers do not appear to have been influenced by the views of the western astronomers, the earlier Greeks or later Arabs. 

It will be sheer stupidity to hold to the theory of trepidation of equinoxes 270 years after it has been definitely proved to be wrong. The law of universal gravitation will not be changed by God Almighty to oblige astrologers. 

APPENDIX 5-E The Jovian Years 

(Bārhaspatya Varṣa) 

The sidereal period of Jupiter, according to the surya Siddhānta is 4332.32 days which is nearly 11.86 sidereal years. Therefore Jupiter roughly stays for one year in one zodiacal sign, if we calculate by mean motion. 

This was taken advantage of to devise & cycle of 12 Jovian years. If we divide the Sūrya Siddhānta period by 12, we get 361.026721 days which is takon as the length of & Jovian year. This is 4.232 days less than the Sūrya Siddhānta solar year. So if & Jovian year and an ordinary solar year begin on the same day, the Jovian year will begin to fall back, completing a complete retrogression in 8501solar years, according to the Sūrya-Siddhānta. 

. The sixty-year cycle is at present'in daily use in Southern 

India (south of Narmada) where each year (the solar year or the luni-solar year) is named after that of the corresponding Jovian year. The years are counted there in regular succes sion and no samvatsara is expunged. This practice is being followed since about 905-06 A.D. (827 śaka), as a result of wbich the number of North-Indian Samvatsara has been gradually gaining over that of the South from that time. The śaka year 1876 (1954-55 A.D.) is named 41 Plavanga in the North while in the South it is 28 Jaya. 

65 

So 85,96 solar years=86.96 Jovian years, and one Jovian 

ULS, & 

211 

year is expunged in every 85 

years. The expunged year 

is called the Kṣaya year. In actual practice, the interval between two expunctions is sometimes 85 and sometimes 86 years. 

There was indeed at one time a period of 12 Jovian years, but at some past epoch, a fivefold multiple, a cycle of 60 Jovian years, each with a special name suffixed by the word 'Samvatsara', came into use. 

The following are the names of the different years : (1) Prabhava (21) Sarvajit (41) Plavaiga (2) Vibbaya (22) Sarvadhārin (42) Kila ka (3) śukla · (23) Virodhin (43) Saumya (4) Pramoda (24) Viksta (44) Sādhāraṇa (5) Prajāpati (25) Khara (45) Virodhakrt (6) Angiras (26) Nandana (46) Paridhāvin (7) Srimukha (27) Vijaya (47) Pramādin.

(14) Vikrama (34) Sarvari (54) Raudra (15) Vrga (35) Plava (55) Durmati (16) Chitrabhānu (36) Subhakrt (56) Dundubhi (17) Subhānu (37) śobbana (57) Rudhirodgārin (18) Tāraṇa (38) Krodhin (58) Raktākṣa (19) Pārthiva (39) Viśvāvasu (59) Krodhana (20) Vyaya (40) Parābhava (60) Kṣaya (Aksaya) 

The beginning of the Jovian years is determined by the entry of Jupiter into an Indian sign by mean motion, the 1st, 13th, 25th, 37th and 49th years being marked by the entry of Jupiter into the sign Kumbha, and not Meṣa which is otherwise the first of the signs of the Siddhāntas. It thus appears that the system of counting Jovian years is a pre-Siddhāntic practice
