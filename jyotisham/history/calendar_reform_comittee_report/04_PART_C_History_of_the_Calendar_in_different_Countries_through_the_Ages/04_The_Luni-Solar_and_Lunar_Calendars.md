## PRINCIPLES OF LUNI-SOLAR CALENDARS 

The Egyptians appear to have been the only cultural nation of antiquity who discarded the moon entirely as a time-marker. Other contemporaneous cultural nations, e.g. the Sumero-Akkadians of Babylon, and the Vedic Indians retained both the sun and the moon as time-markers, the **sun for the year, the moon for the month**. 

The Indian astronomers called the **moon māsakrt**, (month-maker) and before the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa time, the moon was considered more important as a time marker than the sun (vide §5). It was the same with other nations too, for as Pannekoek remarks, we find the opinion written in the sacred books of many nations "For regulating time, the moon has been created". 

The retention of both the sun and the moon, however, gives rise to a multitude of problems, of which a fair summary is given by Pannekoek as follows,* 

"With all peoples of antiquity, the Indians, Babylonians, Jews, Greeks, we find the moon-calendar used ; the period of the moon, the regular sequence of the first appearance of the fine crescent moon in the evening sky, its growth to first quarter, to full moon, at the same time coming up later and filling the whole night, then the decrease to last quarter till its disappearance after the last thin crescent before sunrise was seen, — this regular cycle of the moon's phases in the period of 294 days was everywhere the first basis of chronology". 

"But the calendar could not be satisfactorily fixed with the establishment of the moon-cycle. In these ancient times, the people, the tribe, and the state was a political, spiritual and religious unity. Important events of society, the great agricultural performances, the beginning of the ploughing, the sowing or the harvesting were great popular festivals and at the same time chief religious ceremonies, when offerings were presented to the gods. The moon calendar had to adapt itself to the economic life of the people, which was governed by the cycle of seasons. Thus arose the practical problem of adapting the moon-period of 29.7 days to the solar year of 365 days. This chief problem of ancient chronology has been a mighty impulse to the study of astronomy, because it necessitated continuous observation of the sky." 

* Article on 'Astrology and its influenoe upon the development of Astronomy' by Anton Pannekoek, published in the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, April, 1930. 

**Twelve lunar months** of 29.4 days each, making a total of **354 days**, fall nearly 11 days short of the solar year. In the next year, the beginning of each month occurs 11 days earlier, in three years 33 days will be lost.\* To fix the same month to the same season always, there are no other means than after two or three years to **intercalate a Thirteenth Month**, number 13, by repeating the last month of the year. 

\* The mean duration of a lunar month consists of **29.530588 days** and twelve such lunations amount to **354.36706 days**, while the length of a tropical solar year is 365.24220 days. The length of a lunar year thus falls short of the solar year by 10.87514 days, and instead of there being exactly twelve lunar months in a year, there are 12.36827 months. 

The luni-solar adjustment, which is next taken up, is the first step to the solution of problems stated by Pannekoek; but it is not however the whole solution, for it leaves untouched the problem of correct prediction of the day when the crescent of the moon first appears after new moon in the western horizon. This will be taken up later (vide 84). 

Luni-solar adjustment can be satisfactorily made if we have accurate knowledge of the length of the tropical year, and of the mean length of the lunation. Let us see how these fundamental periods were determined in ancient times. 

### Length of Seasons and the Year 

The length of the year was obtained in Egypt, as we have already seen, from the recurrence of the Nile flood. In Babylonia, no such striking natural phenomena were available. It is very probable that the **Babylonians** early learnt the **use of the gnomon**, with the aid of which they could determine the cardinal days of the year : viz., the summer and winter solstices, and the two equinoxes coming in between. 

The lengths of the seasons were found by counting the number of days from one cardinal day to the next. The number may vary by one day from year to year, and astronomers must have 'realized that the correct length of a season was not a whole number but was fractional. Probably the correct length was found by taking a large number of observations, and taking the mean. The following table shows the length of the seasons and of the year as found by ancient astronomers. 

Table 2. Showing the length of seasons. 

- Spring Summer Autumn Winter
- Euctemon (432 B.C.) 93 90 90 92 = 365
- Calippos (370 B.C.) 94 92 89 92 = 365
- Chaldean (200 B.C.) 94.5 92.73 88.59 91.29 = 365.26
- Correct values for 1384 B.C.  94.09 91.29 88.58 91.29 = 365.25

The length of the year was also found by the same method. The **solar year** is the period between successive transitions of the sun through the same cardinal point. Neugebauer thinks that summer solstice was first used for this purpose in ancient times. But subsequently evidences are found of the use of other cardinal points. 

Thus we find that during the classical period in **Babylon**, the solar year started with the **vernal equinox**. But the **Macedonian Greeks and the Jews** started with the **autumnal equinox**. The **west European countries** appear to have started the solar year with the **winter solstice**.

The number of days in a solar year would vary between 365 and 366. Probably the exact length was determined by counting the number of days between the year-beginnings separated by a large number of years and taking the mean. The Indian practice, followed in the Siddhāntas, is to give the number of days in a Kalpa (a period of 4.32x 10⁹ years) from which one can find out the number of days in a year by simple division. This appears in modern times to be a rather cumbrous practice, but is probably reminiscent of taking the **mean for a large number of years**. 

In ancient times, people had not learnt to follow the motion of the sun in the starry heavens, so they were unaware of the **difference between the sidereal year and the tropical year**. But from their method of measurement, they unconsciously chose the correct, or the tropical year. 

Modern measurements show that the length of the **tropical year is not constant**, but is slowly varying. It is becoming shorter at the rate of .0001 days or 86 secs. in 1600 years. 

So that in Sumerian times, the tropical year had a length of 365.2425 days. The present length is 365.2422 days. 


## MOON'S SYNOPIC PERIOD OR LUNATION : 
EMPIRICAL RELATION BETWEEN THE YEAR AND THE MONTH 

The solar year has thus a pretty nearly constant value, but even the earliest astronomers appear to have observed, that the lunation, or the synodic period of the moon is not a constant, but is variable. As a matter of fact, the period varies from 29.246 to 29.817 days-nearly fourteen hours. The observation of the actual motion of the moon formed the most formidable problem in ancient astronomy (vide §4). 

But all ancient nations show knowledge of an astonishingly correct value of the **mean synodic period**, which is known to be **29.530588** days. This is probably because they could count the number of days with fractions comprising a very large number of lunations, and therefore the mean value came out to be very correct. 

With the aid of the knowledge of correct values of the length of the tropical year, and of the mean synodic period of the moon, it is possible to find out correct rules for luni-solar adjustment, as narrated below. But this could happen only at a later stage. The first stage was certainly empirical as is clearly indicated from a record of the great Babylonian king and law-giver **Hammurabi** (1800 B. C.), which says that the **thirteenth month** was proclaimed by royal order throughout the empire on the advice of priests. All religious observances were forbidden during this period.\* 

\* It is said that in ancient Palestine, the custom was that the **Rabbis went to the fields** and watched the time by their calendar for the ripening of wheat. If the lunar month of Addaru (last month of the year) fell back too much towards winter, they would **proclaim a second Addaru** in that year, so that the first of Nisan would coincide roughly with the ripening of wheate. 

It is not known however, what principles, if any, guided the king or rather his advisers in their selection of the thirteenth month, but most probably the adjustment was empirical, i.e.; the month was discarded when the priests found 'from actual experience that the festival was going out of season, Many ancient nations who used the luni-solar calendar, do not appear to have gone beyond the empirical stage. 

### Empirical Relations between the Solar and Lunar Periods : The Intercalary Months. 

The Chaldean astronomers (as the Babylonians were called after 600 B.C.) appear to have striven incessantly to obtain very accurate values for the mean lunation and the length of the solar: year, and work out at the discovery of mathematical relation ships between these two periods having the form-- 

m lunar months = n solar years  
where both m and n are integers. 

Let us describe some of these relations, 

The **Octaeteris** : This depends on the relation : 

- 8 tropical years = 2921.94 days
- 99 lunar months = 2923.53 days. 

The difference is only 1.59 days in 8 years. We have used here the correct lengths of the two periods. The Babylonian values were slightly different. 

According to this relation, there were to be **three extra** or intercalary **months** in a period of **8 years**, and festivals would fall approximately in the right seasons, if these three months were suitably excluded for religious observances. But the rule was only approxi mate. In a few cycles, the discrepancy would be too large to be disregarded. 

According to the celebrated exponent of Babylonian astronomy, Father Kugler, this system was in vogue from 528 B.C. to 505 B.C., then there was an interval when they used to have **10 intercalary months in a period of 27 years**. From 383 B.C., the Chaldeans used the 19-year cycle, based on the relation : 

- 19 solar years = 6939.60 days 
- 235 lunar months = 6939.69 days. 

There is a discrepancy of .09 days in 19 years, or a mistake of 1 day in 210 years. 

The **19-year cycle, with 7 intercalary months** was used throughout the whole Seleucid times (313 B.C. 75 B.C.), as shown by Pannekoek. This system has not been superseded inspite of various attempts. 

These rules came into vogue at a time (383 B.C.), when Babylon had lost her independence and became a vassal state of the Persian empire of the Acheminids. We do not know what was the original calendar of pre-Acheminid Persia, but the great Acheminid emperor Darius preferred the simpler Egyptian solar calendar to the complex luni-solar calendar of Babylon. The population of Babylon could no longer depend upon the king to adjust the dates of their religious observances by royal decree, as happened in the time of Hammurabi (1800 B.C.). Probably therefore the priest-astronomers felt the need of mathematical rules which should take the place of royal decrees.

The 'Nineteen-year cycle' is generally known as the '**Metonic Cycle**' after Meton, an Athenian astronomer who unsuccessfully tried to introduce it at Athens in 432 B.C. But there is no proof that it was used at Athens before 343 B.C. The question of ‘priority of this discovery is therefore a disputed one.

- Seleucidean era-311 = Christian era A.D. (Jan. to Sept.) 



## BABYLONIANS, MACEDONIANS, ROMANS, AND JEWS 
In addition to the Chaldeans, many other nations of antiquity, viz..the Vedic Indians, the Greeks, the Romans and the Jews and others used the luni-solar calendar, and had to make luni-solar adjustments. It will be tedious to relate how they did it, except in the case of the Vedic Indians (vide § 5). But the knowledge of the nineteen-year rule appears to have diffused to all countries by the first century of the Christian era. From this time onwards, the lunar months of different nations appear to be interchange able. This is shown in the following Table No. 4. 

We have almost complete knowledge of the luni solar calendars of the Babylonians during Seleucid times. The names of months with their normal lengths are shown in column (2) of the table. 

Table 4.-Corresponding Lunar months. 

- Indian - Chaldean - Macedonian - Jewish
- CAITRA Addaru Xanthicos 
- Vaisakha NISANNU (30) Artemesios Nissan 
- Jyaiṣtha Airu (29) Daisios Iyyar 
- Asāḍha Sivannu (30) Panemos Sivan 
- Śrāvana Duzu (29) Loios Tammuz 
- Bhadra Abu (30) Gorpiaios Ab 
- Āśvina Ululu (29) Hyperberetrios Ellul 
- Kārtika Tasritu (30) DIOS TISHRI 
- Mārgasirsa Arah Samnab (29) Appelaios Marheshvan 
- Pauṣa Kisilibu (30) Audynaios Kislev 
- Māgha Dhabitu (29) Peritios Tebeth 
- Phālguna Shabat (30) Dystros Shebat 
- Caitra Addaru (29) Xanthicos Adar and Veadar

The first Babylonian month Nisannu, started with 30 days, and other months were alternately 29 and 30 days. A normal year thus consisted of 354 days, but occasionally an extra day was added to the last month, and it became a year of 355 days. 

The effect of these intercalations was that the first month, viz., the month of **Nisannu**, never strayed for more than 30 days beyond the day of **vernal equinox**.

As the table shows, the Babylonian year might be of **354, 355, 383, or 384 days** duration, and occasionally it is said that they **extended to 385** days. It was therefore impossible to calculate the number of days between two incidents, dated according to the Chaldean calendar, unless the investigator had a table of past years showing the lengths of each individual year. Herein comes the superiority of the Egyptian system, where the number of days between two incidents, dated according to the Egyptian system, could be easily calculated. The two greatest astronomers of ancient times, **Hipparchos and Ptolemy**, therefore, **preferred** **the Egyptian system** of dating to the Chaldean or the Macedonian. 

The **Macedonian Greeks** used the months given in column (3) in their home land. When they settled in Babylon as rulers (313 B.C.), they continued to use the same months, but got them linked to Chaldean months. Their first month was **Dios**, which was the seventh month of Chaldeans. This was probably linked to the **autumnal equinox** in the same way as Nisannu was to the vernal equinox. The Macedonian year started six months earlier than the Chaldean year. 

The Macedonian months were used by the **Parthians, the early Sakas, and the Kushans** in India wihout change of name (vide § 5.5), and probably the month-lengths were also the same as in the Chaldean 19-year system. When the Sakas and Kushans began to rule in India, from first century B.C., they used the Macedonian months alternatively with the Indian months which are shown in the first column. The **first Indian season, Spring,** however, according to immemorial Indian custom, has been on **both sides of the vernal equinox (-30° to 30°),** while in the Graeco Chaldean system, the Spring started with vernal equinox (0°). The first Indian month is Caitra, the first of the spring months, and according to rules prevalent in Siddhāntic times (300 A.D.), the month was to be always on the lower side of the vernal equinox, i.e., the **beginning of lunar Caitra was to be on a date before the vernal equinox**. It may be added that the Indian lunar months mentioned here are amānta or new moon ending. 

## THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ERA
### Early eras 
For accurate date-recording, we require besides the month and the day, also a continuously running era. But the era came rather late in human history. We find dated records of kings in **Babylon** from about 1700 B.C. (Kassite kings). They used **regnal years**, lunar months, and the day of the lunar month. The **ancient Egyptian** records do not use any era, but sometimes the **regnal years**. But the use of regnal years is very inconvenient for purposes of exact chronology, because one has to locate the beginning of the reign of the king on the time-scale which often proves to be an extremely difficult problem, e.g., in India, Emperor **Asoka used regnal years**, but it is a problem of nearly hundred years for archaeologists to find out the exact date of the commencement of his reign. This varies from 273 B.C. to 264 B.C. 

In the writings of the Greek astronomers Hipparchos (140 B.C.) and Ptolemy (150 A.D.), we come across an era purporting to date from the time of one king **Nabu Nazir of Babylon** (747 B.C.), who is known to history, though this era is not used in records of the Babylonian kings themselves. 

The inference has been made, though without clear proof, that the Babylonian or rather Chaldean astronomers who were the earliest systematic observers of the heavenly bodies, get tired of the use of the regnal years, and felt the need of a continuously running era for precision in time-reckoning. They took advantage of a **unique gathering of planets about Feb. 26, 747 B.C. when Nabu Nazir was reigning** in Babylon to proclaim that the gods have ordained the 'introduction of a continuously running era' ( Sky and Telescope, Vol. I, p. 9, April, 1942). 

But the use of the Nabonassar era appears to have been confined to astronomers. The kings continued to record events in their regnal years as this had a great propaganda value for the royal family which they were unwilling to forego. It is now known that the other ancient eras, like that of the **Greek Olympiads (776 B.C.)** or the era of **Foundation of Rome (753 B.C.)** are **extrapolated eras**. The ancient Greek method of dating by Olympiads is of uncertain origin, but the system was critically examined by the Alexandrian chronologists, particularly Eratosthenes (3rd century B.C.), the founder of scientific chronology. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition, Greek chronology is not reliable till the 50th Olympiad (i.e. 576 B.C.). The era was therefore invented a long time after its alleged year of starting. The era of the Foundation of Rome had a similar history (see Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition, Chronology). The starting years of these eras are **suspiciously close to that of the Nabonassar era (747 B.C.)**. Probably both these eras were plagiarized from the era of Nabonassar after the savants of ancient Greece and Rome acquired the time-sense.

It is noteworthy that Hipparchos and Ptolemy used neither the era of Olympiads nor the era of Foundation of Rome, nor Greek or Chaldean months which were lunar, but the Nabonassar era and the more con venient Egyptian solar months. They preferred science to nationalistic chauvinis. 

### The Seleucidean and other derived Eras 
The Seleucidean Era (the S. E. era) : The first continuously running era which ran into general circulation is that introduced to commemorate the foundation of Seleucus's dynasty and dates from the year when Seleucus occupied the city of Babylon after defeating his rivals. There were two methods of counting, differing in the initial year and the first day of the year. 

According to the official (Macedonian) reckoning, the era started from the lunar month of Dios (near autumnal equinox) in the year (-311) A.D. or 312 B.C. The months had Macedonian names. 

According to the native Babylonian reckoning, the era started from the lunar month of Nisan (near vernal equinox) six months later than the starting of the Macedonian year. The months had Chaldean names, as given in Table No. 4. 

The Seleucid monarchs ruled over a vast empire from Syria to the borders of Afghanistan from 311 B.C. to 65 B.C. 8.e., nearly for 250 years and under their rule, the knowledge of Graeco-Chaldean astronomy and time-calculations spread far and wide, ultimately reaching India, and profoundly modifying the indigenous system in India. The use of Macedonian months spread over all these countries, as is apparent from contemporary inscriptions and coin-datings mentioned in § 5.5. The months were amānta, i.e., started after the new-noon was completed and were pegged on to the solar year which started on the day of the vernal equinox. The Nisan was the first lunar month after the vernal equinox. There were **7 intercalary months in a period of 19 years**. The correspondence between Chaldean and Greek months and the position of the intercalary months have been worked out by Prof. Pannekoek between the years 134-247 of the Seleucidean era, as already given (vide § 3.2 and 3.3) along with their Indian equivalent lunar months. 

## The Parthian Era 
Since the introduction of the Seleucidean era, the practice arose for a nation or a dynasty to start eras commemorating some great event in their national or dynastic life. The first in record is the Parthian era, and the story of its starting is well-known. The Seleucid emperors ruled the Near East from 312 B.C. imposing on the countries under their domination Greek culture, the Seleucidean era, and the Graeco Chaldean system of time-reckoning. About 250 B.C., there were wide-spread revolts against Seleucid rule in Bactria, in Parthia (Eastern Persia), and other parts of the Near East. The revolt in Parthia was led by one Arsaces and his brother Tiridates who belonged to an Iranian tribe, which had adopted Greek culture. To commemorate their liberation from Seleucidean rule, the Parthians introduced an era, beginning **64 years after the Seleucid era (i.e. 248 B.C.)**. But at first this era (**Arsacid era**) was only rarely used. The early Parthian emperors preferred to use on their coins the Seleucidean era, the Macedonian months, and the Graeco-Chaldean system of time reckoning inscribed in Greek letters. In the **first century A.D.**, there was a **Zoroastrian revival**, the S.E. was dropped in favour of the Parthian era and Pehlevi began to be used in place of Greek, though Macedonian month-names were still kept. 

Though kings bearing Parthian names ruled at Taxila about the first century B.C. to first century A.D., e.g., king Gondophernes, no clear evidence of the use of the Parthian era on Indian soil has yet been found. 

It is very likely that the **śaka era**, with its methods of calendar-reckoning, which came into vogue in India during the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa times, was started by the **śaka tribes** when they attained prominence, and started an era of their own, in **imitation of the Parthians**. They, however, retained the Graeco Chaldean method of lunar month-reckoning and probably the same system of intercalary months.

## THE JEWISH CALENDAR 
The ancient Jewish calendar was lunar, the beginning of the month being determined by the first visibility of the lunar crescent. As the month-names show (col. 4 of the table No. 4.), they were evidently derived from the **Babylonian month-names** excepting one or two, viz., Marheshvan and Tammuz. The **day began in the evening** and probably at sunset. The year used to begin with the **spring month Abib or Nisan**, the latter being the Babylonian name of the month which was adopted by the Jews in the post-exilic times. **Intercalation** was performed, when necessary, repeating the twelfth month 'Adar' which was then known as Veadar followed by Adar. The year beginning was subsequently changed and in the last century before Christ, it became the month of Tishri, corresponding to the Macedonian month of Dios. This must have been due to the desire or need to follow the practice of the ruling race. 

Originally there were no definite rules for inter calation and for fixing up the beginning of the months. Because various religious festivals and sacrifices were fixed with reference to the beginning of the month, information about it was spread throughout the country by messengers and by signal fires on hilltops. 

About the 4th century A.D., fixed rules were introduced in the calendar and nothing was left to observation or discretion. **Intercalation is governed by a 19-year cycle** in which the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th and 19th years have got an extra month. The actual beginning of the initial month of the year, viz., Tishri is obtained from the mean new-moon by complicated rules which are designed to prevent certain solemn days from falling on inconvenient days of the week. As a result, a common year may consist of 353, 354 or 355 days and an embolismic or leap-year of 383, 384 or 385 days. Ten of the months have got fixed durations of 29 or 30 days, as well as the intercalary month which contains 30 days, the other two varying according to the requisite length of the year. 

#### The Jewish Era of Creation 
The Jews use an Era (Anno Mundi, libriath olum) or 'Era of Creation' which is supposed to have been started from the day of creation of the world. We quote the following passages from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition, 'Chronology, Jewish'. 

- (1) The era is supposed to begin, according to the mnemonic Beharad, at the beginning of the lunar cycle on the night between Sunday and Monday, Oct. 7, 3761 B.C., at 11 hours 115 minutes P.M. This is indicated by be beth, (two, i.e., 2nd day of week), ha (he, five, i.e., fifth hour after sunset) and Rad (Resh, dalet, 204 minims after the hour). 
- (2) In the Bible various eras occur, e.g., the Flood, the Exodus, the Earthquake in the days of King Uzziah, the regnal years of monarchs and the Babylonian exile. During the **exile** and after, Jews reckoned by the **years of the Persian kings**. Such reckonings occur not only in the Bible (e.g., Daniel viii, I) but also in the Assouan papyri. After **Alexander**, the Jews employed the **Seleucid era** (called Minyan Shetaroth, or **era of deeds**, since legal deeds were dated by this era). So great was the influence exerted by Alexander, that this era persisted in the East till the 16th century, and is **still not extinct in south Arabia**. This is the only era of antiquity that has survived. Others, which fell into disuse, were the **Maccabaean eras**, dating from the accession of each prince, and the national era (143-142 B.C.), when Judæa became free under Simon. That the era described in Jubilees was other than hypothetical, is probable. Dates have also been reckoned from the fall of the second Temple (Le-Horban hab-bayyith). The equation of the eras is as follows : 

Year 1 after destruction = A.M. 3831 = 383 Seleucid = A.D. 71 

The '**Era of Creation**' is supposed to have started from the day of autumnal equinox of the year 3761 B.C. So the sun and the moon must have existed before the day of creation !!+++(5)+++ 

## THE ISLAMIC CALENDAR 

The Mohammedan calendar is **purely lunar** and has no connection with the solar year. The year consists of 12 lunar months, the beginning of each month being determined by the first observation of the crescent moon in the evening sky. The months have accordingly got 29 or 30 days and the **year 354 or 355 days**. The **new-year day** of the Mohammedan calendar thus retrogrades through the seasons and **completes the cycle in a period of about 324 solar years**. 

The era of the Mohammedan calendar, viz., the Hejira (A.H.), which was probably introduced by the **Caliph Umar about 638-639 A.D.**, started from the **evening of 622 A.D., July 15, Thursday**, when the crescent moon of the first month Muharram of the Mohammedan calendar was first visible. This was the new-year day preceding the emigration of Muhammad from Mecca which took place about Sept. 20 (8 Rabi I), 622 A.D. 


As the **day** of the Islamic calendar **commences from sunset**, **Friday** started from the evening of that day. 


For astronomical and chronological purposes the lengths of the months are however fixed by rule and not by observation. The lengths of the months in days for this purpose are as follows: 

- Muharram 30
- Safar 29
- Rabi-ul awwal 30 
- Rabi-us sani 29
- Jamada'l awwal ....... 30 
- Jamada-s sani 29
- Rajab  30
- Shaban 29
- Ramadan  30
- Shawal ....29 
- Zilkada . ......30 
- Zilhijja . ......29 (or 30) 

The **leap-year**, in which Zilhijja has one day more, contains 355 days and is known as Kabishah. In a cycle of 30 years, there are 19 common years of 354 days and 11 leap-years of 355 days. Thus 360 lunations are made equivalent to 10,631 days or only :012 days less than its actual duration. The rule for determining the leap year of this fixed 'calendar is that, if after dividing the Hejira year by 30, the remainder is 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26 or 29, then it is á leāp-year. 

The only purely lunar calendar is the Islamic Calendar, which has been in vogue amongst the followers of Islam since the death of the Prophet Muhammad (632 A.D). But it is well-known that **before this period Mecca observed some kind of luni solar calendar** in common with all countries of the Near East. The common story is that when pilgrims from distant countries and other parts of Arabia came to perform Hajj at Mecca (**Hajj** is a pre-Islamic practice), they often found that it was an intercalary month according to Meccan calculation, when no religious festival could be performed, and had to wait for a month before they were allowed to perform the rites. This meant great **hardships for distant visitors** and to prevent recurrence of such incidents the **Prophet forbade the use of intercalary or 13th month** and decreed that the calendar should henceforth be purely lunar. 

It has now been shown by Dr. Hashim Amir Ali of the Osmania University, Hyderabad, that the Mohammedan calendar was originally luni-solar in which intercalation was made when necessary, and not purely lunar. This view-point has now been strongly supported by Mohammed Ajmal Khan of the Ministry of Education, Govt. of India. They emphasize that upto the last year of the life of Mohammed, i.e., upto A.H. 10 or A.D. 632, a thirteenth month was intercalated when necessary. The Arabs, among whom there were relatively few men conversant with astronomical calculations, had a system in which a family of astronomers, known as **Qalammas** was responsible for proclaiming at the Hajj (falling in the last month of the year : Zilhijja) that a thirteenth month would or would not be added. Astronomically such intercalation should be made **3 times in 8 years or 7 times in 19 years**. The elder of the Qalamma had a certain amount of discretion in determining when this intercalation was to be practised, and this very practice afterwards caused great confusion.

According to this view, proper intercalation was applied in all the years where necessary upto A.H. 10 and consequently the year A.H. 11 (coming next to the Hajj of A.H. 10) which started on March 29, 632 A.D. (i.e., after the vernal equinox day) seems to have been a rather normal year, and as such all the previous new-year days appear to have been celebrated on the visibility of the crescent moon after the veral equinox day. The Muslim months should accordingly occupy permanent places in the seasons as follows\* : 

- Muharram... Mar.-April 
- Rajab ... Sept.-Oct. 
- Safar... ... April-May 
- Shaban ... Oct.—Nov. 
- Rabi I ... May - June 
- Ramadan ...Nov.-Dec. 
- Rabi II ... June — July 
- Shawal ... Dec.-Jan. 
- Jamadi I ... July --Aug. 
- Zilkada ... Jan. - Feb. 
- Jamadi II ... Aug. Sept. 
- Zilhijja ...Feb. -Mar. 

\* If this view is accepted, it would then be necessary to shift the starting epoch of the Hejira era, which is commonly accepted as July 16, 622 A.D., to an earlier date, ag 4 intercalary months or 118 days will then have to be inserted between the new-year days of A.H. 1 and of A.H. 11, which is March 29, 632 A.D. The initial epoch of the Hejira era thus arrived at is the evening of March 19, 622 A.D., Friday, the day following the vernal equinox.
