The Julian year of 365,25 days was longer than the true year of 365.2422 by .0078 days, so the winter solstice day which fell on December 21 in 323 A.D., fell back by 10 days in 1582 A.D. and the Christmas day appeared to be losing all connections with the winter solstice. Similar discrepancy was also noticed in connection with the observance of the Easter.* Various proposals were made for correcting the error and the Council of Trent which assembled in 1545 authorised 'the Pope to deal with the matter. When in 1572, Gregory XIII became Pope, these schemes were considered and the plan that was most

The Jews, it may be mentioned, reckon the days by ordinal numbers--the first, second......... seventh day. The first day is Saturday. 

The seven-day week, from the account of its origin is clearly based on astrological ideology. The conti nuous seven-day week was unknown to the classical Greeks, the Romans, the Hindus, and early Christians. It was introduced into the Christian world by an edict of the Roman emperor Constantine, about 323 A.D., who changed the Sabbath to the Lord's Day (Sunday), the week-day next to the Jewish Sabbath. Its introduction into India is about the same time and from the same sources. The week-days are not found in earlier Hindu scriptures like the Vedas or 

...* Easter, the most joyous of the Christian festivals, is observed ..apnually throughout Christendom in commemoration of the resurrec 

tion of Jesus Christ, on the first Sunday after the full-moon following the vernal equinox day. The last days of Christ coincided with the Passover fast of the Jews and his death fell upon the day of the feast of the Passover, on the 14th day of the month of Nisan. As the date of Easter is associated with the moon's phases, as well as the vernal equinox day, it is a movable festival, falling anywhere between March 22 and April 25. A movement is going on for narrowing down the range of variation of the Easter day ; in 1928 the British Parliament passed the Easter Act, which contingent upon its acceptance internationally, fixed Easter day as the first Sunday after the second Baturday in April, falling between April 9 and 15.
