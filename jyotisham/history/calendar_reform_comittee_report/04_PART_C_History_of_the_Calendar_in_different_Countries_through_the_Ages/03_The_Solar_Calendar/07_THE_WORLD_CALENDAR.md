The objections to the World Calendar plan come from several Jewish organizations, on the ground that the World Calendar plan interferes with the unbroken seven-day week, by introducing Worlds day and Leap-year. Day without any week-day denomination. This, they say, will interfere with their religious life. 

As already shown, the religious sanction for the seven-day cycle is either non-existent, or slight, amongst communities other than the Jews, and even amongst them, it dates only from the first century A. D. The claims of certain Jewish Rabbis to prove that the seven-day week cycle has been ordained by God Almighty from the moment of creation which event, according to these Jewish Rabbis, took place on the day of the autumnal equinox, also a new moon day, is a fantastic conception of medieval scholars, which no sane man can entertain in these days of Darwin and Einstein, 

fraction of people who would want to observe their religious rites according to established usage. 

But these inconveniences can be adjusted by agreement, and it would be egoistical on the part of a particular community or communities to try to impede the passage of a measure of such great useful ness to the whole of mankind on the plea that the World Calendar plan interferes with the continuous seven-day week. Calendars are based on Science, which everybody must bow to ; and on Convention, which may be altered by mutual consent. The unbroken seven-day week is a Convention, but the World Calendar plan bas proposed a far better Conven tion, which should be examined on its own merits.* 

As a result of a request from the Government of India, the proposal of the World Calendar Reform had become the subject of discussion at the eighteenth session of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations held at Geneva during June-July, 1954. Professor M. N. Saha, F. R. S., Chairman, Calendar Reform Committee, attended the ECOSOC meeting at Geneva to explain the desirability of the proposed reform. 

The World Calendar plan has no intention of interfering with the characteristic calendars of communities or nations. They can exist side by side with the World Calendar. For such communities as intend to maintain the continuous seven-day week, their religious week-days, including Sundays, would no doubt wander through the World Calendar week days, and cause some inconvenience to the very small
