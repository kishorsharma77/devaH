##  THE MOON'S MOVEMENT IN THE SKY 

The scheme of lunar months given in Table No. 4 in a nineteen-year period, which came into vogue in Babylon about 383 B.C. did not, however, completely satisfy the needs of the Babylonian calendar, because for religious purposes, the month was to start on the day the crescent moon was first visible in the western horizon after conjunction with the sun (the new moon), a custom which is still followed in the Islamic countries. But the first visibility may not occur on the predicted day for manifold reasons. 

The table given on p. 176 is based on mean values of the of the lengths of the year and the synodic month, which is equivalent to the assumption that the sun and the moon move uniformly in the same great circle in the heavens. But even the most primitive observers could not fail to notice that neither do the two luminaries move in the same path, nor do they move uniformly, each in its own path. 

The motion of the moon amongst the stars is the easiest to observe. This is illustrated in the two figures reproduced from the Sky and Telescope, giving positions of the moon, the sun, and the planets in the field of fixed stars in the months of June and July, 1953.

- Fig. 2-Showing the positions of the sun, moon and planets among the stars in June, 1953. 
- Fig. 3–Showing the positions of the sun, moon and planets among the stars in July, 1953. 


The central horizontal line is the line of the celestial equator (§ 4.4), and the sinuous line represents the ecliptic or the sun's path (8 4.5), but we may ignore these now, and simply concentrate on the moon and the stars or star-clusters near which it passes. 

The moon begins as a thin crescent on the western horizon on the evening of June 12, the day of the first visibility after the new-moon, at an angle of 11°, from the sun which has just set, below the bright stars Castor and Pollux (Punarvasū). Then we notice the position of the moon, on successive evenings at sunset: We find she is moving eastward at the rate of about 13° and becoming fuller (increasing in phase). She passes the bright star Regulus (Magha) on the 17th, on the 19th, she is half and passes B Leonis (Uttara Phalguni) leaving it a good deal to the north. Then she passes the bright star Spica ( α Virginis or Citra) on the 21st, and is then gibbous on the 23rd near the star a-libra (Visakha). Then she passes the well known Scorpion-cluster and becomes full on the 27th, near a star-cluster which cannot be seen on the night of full-moon, but can be detected later as the star cluster Sagittarius. On the full moon day, she rises nearly at sunset, at 180° from the sun (opposition). On each successive night after full moon she rises later and later, and passes the phases in the reverse order, i.e., becomes gibbous+++(=convex)+++ on June 30, when she has the bright star Altair (Śravaṇa) far to the north and is half on July 4, and becomes a crescent on July 7 on the eastern sky, and then fails to appear for three days, and must have passed the sun on the 11th July which is the new moon day, when she is with the sun (Amārasyā or conjunction, lit. the sun and the moon living together). On the 12th July, she reappears on the western horizon as a thin crescent, near the star ó-Cancri (Puṣya), and the cycle again starts. 

The crescent of the moon, either in the western or the eastern sky, is always turned away from the sun. 

The ancients must have observed the motion of the moon day after day, from new-moon to new-moon (a full lunation or lunar month) and become familiar with the stars or star-clusters which she passes. It is always easy to observe them when the moon is a crescent ; when the moon becomes fuller, the stars are lost in the moon's glare particularly if they are faint. But if observations be carried on for a number of years, the observers would become familiar with all the stars or star-clusters which the moon passes. 

By observations like this, the ancients must have found that both the moon and the sun are moving to the east, the moon very fast, the sun more slowly. By the time the moon, after making a whole round, comes back to the sun, the latter has moved further to the east by about 30°. For example in the above figures Nos. 2 and 3, the sun was somewhat to the west of the bright star-group Orionis (Mrgasiras) to the west of Castor and Pollux on June 11th, the day of the new moon. But on the next new-moon day, July 11th, she has moved near Castor and Pollux (Punarvasū) about 30° to the east. 

The ancients must have found that the moon takes a little over 27.3 days (sidereal period of the moon), to return to the same star, but to overtake the sun, it takes a little longer, a little over 29.5 days (the synodic period of the moon). Exactly, 

the mean sidereal period=27.321661 days = 27d 7h 43m 118s5 with a variation of 3.5 hours and the mean synodic period =29.530588 days = 29d 12h 44m 2s. with a variation of 7 hours. 

### The Lunar Mansions
Many ancient nations developed the habit of designating the day-to-day (or night-to-night) position of the moon by the stars or star-clusters it passed on successive nights. The number of such stars or star clusters was either 27 or 28 ; the ambiguity was due to the fact that the mean sidereal period of the moon is about 27.5 days, the actual period having a variation of seven hours, and the ancients who did not know how to deal with fractions, oscillated between 27 and 28. In India, originally there were 28 nakṣatras, but ultimately 27 was accepted as the number of lunar nakṣalras (or asterisms). 

The lunar zodiac is also found amongst the Chinese who designate them by the term Hsiu ; and amongst the Arabs, who call them Manzil, both terms denoting mean signs. Both the Chinese and the Arabs had 28 mansions. The Indian term 'nakṣatra' is of uncertain etymological origin. Some hold that the term nakṣatra carried the sense that 'it does not move' and meant a star. 

Names of certain nakṣatras' are found in the oldest scriptures of India, viz., the Rg-Vedas, but a full list is first found in the Yajurveda (vide § 5-3). In the older classics of India ( the Yajurveda, the Mahābhārata), the nakṣatras invariably start with Kritikā, the Pleiades ; the supposition has been made that the Kritikās were near the vernal point, when this enumeration was started. This is apparent from the couplet found in the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa which runs thus : 

Taittiriya Brāhmana, i, 1, 2, 1. Krttikāsv agnimādadhita. Mukham vā etan nakṣatrānām, Yat krttikā. Translation: One should consecrate the (sacred) fire in the Krttikās ;--the Kritikās are the mouth of the nakṣatras. 

Later during Siddhānta Jyotiṣa times the enumeration started with Aśvini β Arietis) and this is still reckoned to be the first of the naksatras, although the vernal point has now receded to the Uttarabhādrapada group which should accordingly be taken as the first nakṣatra. But the change has not been done because the Indian astrologers have failed to correct the calendar for the precession of equinoxes. 

The Chinese start their Hsius with Citrā or α Virginis. This refers probably to the time when α Virginis was near the autumnal equinoctial point (285 A.D.). The Arabs start their Manzils with β Arietis (Ash-Sharaţāni). 

There has been a good deal of controversy regarding the place of origin of the lunar zodiac. Many savants were inclined to ascribe the origin of the 27 nakṣatra system to ancient Babylon, like all other early astronomical discoveries. But as far as the authors of this book are aware, there is no positive evidence in favour of this view. Thousands of clay tablets containing astronomical data going back to 2000 B.C., and extending up to the first century A.D. have been obtained, but none of them are known to have any reference to 27 or 28 lunar mansions. 

On the other hand (as mentioned before) some of the nakṣatra names are found in the oldest strata of the Rg-Vedas (vide § 5-2), which must be dated before 1200 B.C., and a full list with some difference in names is found in the Yajur-Veda, which must be dated before 600 B.C. Nobody has yet been able, to refute yet Max Muller's arguments in favour of the **indigenous origin of the Indian nakṣatra system** given in his preface to the Rg-Veda Samhitā, page xxxv. 

It should be admitted that the lunar zodiac was pre scientific, i.e., it originated before astronomers became conscious of the celestial equator and the ecliptic, and began to give positions of steller bodies with these as reference planes. The nakṣatras give very roughly the night-to-night position of the moon, by indicating its proximity to stars and star-groups. Many of the Indian stațs identified as nakṣatras are not at all near the ecliptic or the moon's path which, on account of its obliquity, is contained in a **belt within +5° of the ecliptic**. Such are for example : 

- (15) **Svāti**, which is identified with Arcturus Ta Bootis), which has a latitude of 31° N. 
- (22) **śravaṇa**, identified with α, β, y Aquilae, having the latitude of 29° N. 
- (23) **Śraviṣthā**, identified with α, β, Y, δ Delphini, a having the latitude of 33° N. 
- (25) **pūrva Bhādrapada** identified with α Pegasi and some other adjacent stars, α Pegasi having latitude of 19° N. 

At one time, the brilliant star **Vega (α Lyrae)** was also, included making 28 naksatras. But this has a latitude of 62° N and was later discarded. 

No satisfactory argument has been given for the inclusion of such distant stars in the lunar zodiac: The **Arabs and the Chinese** do not include these distant stars in their lunar zodiac, but **fainter ones near the ecliptic**, Prof. P. C. Sengupta is of the opinion that Indians generally preferred bright stars, but when such were not available near the ecliptic, they chose brighter ones away from the ecliptic, which could be obtained on the **line joining the moon's cusps**. 

The **nakṣatras were used to name the 'days'** in the earliest strata of Indian literature. Thus when the moon is expected to be found in the Maghā nakṣatra (α Leonis), the day would be called the Maghā day. This is the oldest method of designating the day, for it is found in the Rg-Vedas. Other methods of designating the day by **tithis or lunar days**, or by the seven week-days, came later. The system has continued to the present times. In old times, astrology was based almost entirely on the nakṣatras, e.g., in Asoka's records, the Puṣya nakṣatra day was regarded as auspicious when brāhmaṇas and Sramaṇas were fed, in order to enhance the king's puṇya (religious merits). In the Mahābhārata also we find that the days are designated by nakṣatras which apparently mean the star or star cluster near which the moon is expected to be seen during the night. 

As is apparent from Table No. 5, the nakṣatras are at **rather unequal distances**, i.e., they rarely follow the ideal distance of 13.5°. This is rather inconvenient for precision time-reckoning. We find in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa times an attempt at a precise definition of the **two limits of a nakṣatra**, which was defined as 800' ( 13° 20') of the ecliptic. The nakṣatra was named according to the most prominent star (**Yogatārā**) contained within these limits. These are given in. column (2) of Table 5.

Positions of the Junction Stars of Nakṣatra Divisions of the Siddhāntas  

<div class="spreadsheet" src="../../yogatAra_in_siddAnta_naxatras_1956.csv" separator=","> </div>  


We do not, however, have any idea as to how the beginnings and endings of the nakṣatra divisions were fixed in India. The prominent ecliptic stars which were used as Yogatārās (junction-stars) in pre-Siddhāntic period, are not distributed at regular intervals along the ecliptic ; and so it was found very difficult to include the stars in their respective equal divisions. This will be clear from table (No. 5) where the junction stars of the nakṣatras according to the Sūrya "Siddhānta are given in col. (2). The celestial longitudes of the stars for 1956 A.D. are given in col. (4) and the beginnings of each division for the same year are given in col. (5), taking the **star α Virginis to occupy the middle position of the nakṣatra Citrā**, which marked the **position of the autumnal equinox** at the time The divisions of nakṣatras shown in the table, as when the table was compiled. The figures in the last already stated, has been based on the assumption that column represent the position of the star in the naksatra the star Spica occupies the 180th degree of the lunar division of that name. It seems that a few of the zodiac. This arrangement agrees with the statement Yogatārās, viz, **No. 6 ārdrā, No. 15 Svātī, No. 18 Jyeṣthā, No. 20 Purvāṣādha, No. 21 Uttarāṣadhā, No. 22 Śravaṇa, and No. 23 Dhaniṣthā fall outside the naksatra division of which they are supposed to form the Yogatārā**. Matters do not improve much, if we shift the beginning of each division so as to place & Piscium (Revati) at the end of the Revati division or in other words at the beginning of the Aśvini division. This will mean that the figures in col. (6) will then have to be increased by 3° 59', which will push up the Yogatārās of 1 Aśrini, 2 Bharani, 3* Krtrikā, 8 Pista 13 Hasta, 25 P. Bhādrapalā, and 26 U. Bhadrapada, so as to go outside the nakşatra division of which they form the Yogatārā. In fact **no arrangement at any time appears to have been satisfactory enough for all the Yogatārās to fall within their respective naksatra divisions**.

The divisions of nakṣatras shown in the table, as already stated, has been based on the assumption that the star Spica occupies the 180th degree of the lunar zodiac. This arrangement agrees with the **statement of the Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa that the Dhanisṭhā star (α or β Delphini) marked the beginning of the Dhaniṣṭhā division**, and also of the **Varāha's Sūrya Siddhānta that Regulus (α Leonis) is situated at the 6th degree of the Maghā division**.

##  LONG PERIOD OBSERVATIONS OF THE MOON - THE CHALDEAN SAROS 
The moon gains on the sun at the average rate of 12.2° per day, but it did not take the ancients long to discover that the daily gain of the moon on the sun is far from uniform ; in fact as we know now, it varies from approximately 10.75° to 14.5° per day. It was therefore not possible to say beforehand whether the crescent moon would appear on the 29th or on the 30th day after the beginning of the previous month.

But the exact prediction of the day was a nécessity from the socio-religious point of view. In India, the month was measured from full-moon to full-moon, and in the Mahābhārata, the great epic which was compiled from older materials about 400 B. C., it is recorded that sometimes the full moon occurred on the thirteenth day after the new-moon, This was taken to forebode great calamities for mankind. There were similar ideas in Babylon of which Pannekoek says: 

"When the Moon is full on the night of the 14th, the normal time, it was a lucky omen ; when full-moon happened on the night of the 13th, 15th or 16th, it was abnormal, hence & bad omen. Here astrology and calendar were merged ; deviation in the calendar was considered an unlucky, sign and had to be restored at the end of the month.»* 

Neugebauer says : 

"The months of the Babylonian calendar are always real lunar months, the first day of which begins with the first visibility of the new crescent. The exact prediction of this phenomenon is the main problem of the lunar theory as known to us from about 250 B.C. onwards." + 

This is rather comparatively late date. The reason is that the accomplishment of this objective depends on the evolution of methods of exact astronomical observations, and of a method of recording them in precise mathematical language. Some ancient people never reached this stage. As far as we are aware, the ancient Babylonians were the first to evolve methods of observational astronomy. They also arrived at the principles of angular measurements, found the apparent paths of the moon, the sun, and the planets in the heavens, and discovered that it was only the sun's path (the ecliptic) which was fixed, and the paths of the moon, and the planets deviated somewhat from it. How this was done will be related later. 

But even before these accurate methods had been discovered, the Babylonian astronomers had learnt a lot more about the moon from long period observa tions. The most remarkable of these discoveries is that of the Chaldean Saros, or a period of 18 years 101 days, in which the eclipses of the sun and the moon recur. 

The occurrence of solar or lunar eclipses, when the two great luminaries disappear suddenly, either partially or wholly, were very striking phenomena for the ancient and medieval people, and gave rise to gloomy forebodings. There were all kinds of speculations about the cause of the eclipses, e.g., that the sun and the moon were periodically devoured by demons or dragons. The ancient astronomers, however, found that a solar eclipse takes place only near conjunction (new-moon ), but every conjunction of the sun and the modn is not the occasion for a solar eclipse: A lunar eclipse takes place only pear opposition (full moon), but every opposition of the sun and the moon is not the occasion for a lunar eclipse. 

In many ancient countries, China and Babylon for example, records of occurrence of eclipses had been kept. The celebrated Greek astronomer, Ptolemy of Alexandria (ca. 150 A. D.) had before him a record of eclipses kept at the Babylonian archives, dating from 747 B. C. They gave date of occurrence, time. and features of the eclipse, whether they were partial or total. From an analysis of these records, the Chaldean astronomers tried to discover the laws of periodicity of eclipses, which ultimately resulted in the discovery of the Saros cycle of 18 years and 10 or 11 days. The basis of the Saros cycle is as follows: . 

We do not exactly know when the ancient astronomers outgrew the myth of demons periodically devouring the sun and the moon during eclipse times, and arrived at the physical explanations now known to every student of astronomy, and reproduced in the diagrams given below. 

Fig. 4—Showing an eclipse of the moon. 

But when they arrived at physical explanation of eclipses, they had an understanding as to why there are no eclipses during every full moon and new moon. The paths of the two luminaries must be in different planes. This we take up in a subsequent section more fully, when we describe how the sun's path or ecliptic was discovered. 

Suffice it to say that at some ancient epoch, some Chaldean astronomer discovered that the moon's path was different from the sun's, and therefore cuts the sun's path at two points, now called Nodes. The condition for an eclipse to happen is that the full moon and new-moon must take place sufficiently close to the Nodes, otherwise the luminaries would be too far apart, for an eclipse to take place. 

The Nodes' now take the place of the mythical dra gons which were supposed to waylay the sun and the moon, periodically, and swallow and disgorge them. In Hindu astronomy, the ascending node is called

##  THE GNOMON
Observations of the positions of the sun, the moon, planets and stars are now made very accurately with elaborate instruments installed in observatories. But these instruments have been evolved after thousands of years of experience and application of human ingenuity, and have undergone radical changes in design and set-up with every great technological discovery. But let us see how the early astronomers who had no instruments or very primitive ones made observations, collected the fundamental data, and evolved the basic astronomical ideas. 

The earliest instrument used-by primitive astrono mers appears to have been the gnomon; which we now describe.

into the gand, might have noticed that its shadow turned around during the day and that it varied in length as it turned. The gnomon in its simplest form was the systematization of that casual experiment. Instead of a spear, a measured stick was established solidly in a vertical position in the middle of a horizontal plane, well smoothed out and unobstructed all around in order that the shadow could be seen clearly from sunup to sundown. The astro nomor (the systematic user of the gnomon deserves that name) observing the shadow throughout the year would see that it reached a minimum every day (real noon), and that minimum varied from day to day, being shortest at one time of the year (summer solstice) and longest six months later (winter solstice). Moreover, the direction of the shadow turned around from West to East during each day, describing a fan the amplitude of which varied througout the year".* 

From the observation of the shadows cast by the gnomon, many useful deductions could be made. These are : 

(1) Mark the points in the morning and in the evening when the shadows are equal in length and draw the lines showing the shadows. Then bisect the angle between the two shadow lines. This gives us the meridian or the north-south direction of the 

· place.. 

The process of bisection was done by taking a rope attaching extreme points to the end points of the equal shadows ; then take the mid-point of the rope, and stretch the rope, and mark the position of the mid-point. This connected to the pole gives us the meridian line. If we draw a circle, with the pole as centre, and draw the meridian, the point where it strikes the northern semi-circle is the North point, opposite is the South point. The' East and West points are found by drawing a line at right angles to the north-south direction. 

So the cardinal directions are found. 

(2) Observe the position of the sunrise from day to day. If observations are carried on throughout the year, there will be found two days in the year when the sun will arise exactly on the east point. Then it is found that the day and night are equal in length. These days are called the Equinoctial days. Let us start from the equinoctial day in Spring (vernal equinox). This happens on March 21st. Then we observe that the sun at sunrise is steadily moving to the north, at first rapidly, then more slowly. Near the extreme north, the sun's movement is very slow, so this point is called the 'Solstice which means the sun standing still. Actually the sun reaches its northern-most point on June 22 (summer solstice). 

Fig. 7-The gnomon 

The ancients determined the latitude of the place, obliquity of the ecliptic, the length of the year and the time of day by measuring the length and direction of shadow of the gnomon, The figure shows the noon-shadow of the gnomon AB, AE being the equinoctial shadow and AC and AD the shadow on 

two solstice-days, at a place on latitude = 0. 

Nobody can fail to see the change in direction and length of shadows of vertical objects throughout the day-time, and throughout the year. When these observations are carefully made, by means of the gnomon ( Banku in Sanskrit ), which is simply a vertical stick planted into the ground, and standing on fairly level ground of large area, without obstruc- tions from any direction, a good deal of astronomical knowledge can be easily deduced. These observations appear to have been made in all ancient countries. 

We have the following description, by George Sarton, of observations made in ancient times in Greece with the aid of the gnomon.* 

"It (the gromon) is simply a stick or a pole planted vertically in the gror or one might use a column built for that purpose or for any other ; the Egyptian obelisks would have been perfect gnomons if sufficiently isolated from other buildings. Any intelligent person, having driven his spear 

* Sarton mentions Anaximander (C. 610-545 B.C.) of Miletus as the earliest Ionian philosopher who used the gnomon in Greater Greece.

The day is longest on this date. Then the sun begins to move south till it crosses the east point on September 23, when day and night again become equal (the autum nal equinox day). It continues to move south, till the extreme south is reached on December 22, (the winter solstice day), when daylight is shortest for places on the northern hemisphere. Then the sun turns back towards the east point reaching it on March 21, and the year-cycle is complete.. 

• The gnomon thus enabled the ancient astronomers (in Babylon, India, Greece, and China) to determine : 

(a) The Cardinal points : East, North, West, and South ; the north-south line is the meridian line (the Yamyottara-rekha in Indian astonomy); 

(b) The Cardinal days of the Year : viz., 

The Vernal Equinox (V.E.) day, when day and night are equal. 

The Summer Solstice (S.S.) day, when the day is the longest for observers on the northern hemisphere. 

The Autumnal Equinox (A.E.) day, when day and night are again equal. 

The Winter Solstice (W.S.) day, when the day is the shortest for observers on the northern hemisphere. 

All early astronomical work was done in the northern hemisphere. 

These methods are fully described in the Surya Siddhānta, Chap. III, but they appear to have been practised from far more ancient times. In the :: appendix (5-C), we have quoted passages from the Aitareya Brāhmana which shows that the gnomon was used to determine the cardinal days of the year at the time when this ritualistic book was compiled. The date is at least 600 B.C., i.e., before India had the Greek contact. It may be considerably older everr. 

(c) To mark out the Seasons : We have mentioned earlier that in countries other than Egypt, there were no impressive physical phenomenon like the arrival of the annual flood of the Nile to mark the beginning of the solar year, or of the seasons. The seasons pass imperceptibly from the one to the other. 

The gnomon observations probably enabled the early astronomers of Babylon and Greece to define the onset of the seasons, and the length of the year with greater precision. 

In Graeco-Chaldean astronomy, we have four seasons : 

Spring ... - from V.E. to S.S. Summer... ... „ Sis. to A.E. Autumn...... , A.E. to W.S. 

Winter. ... » W.$. to V.E. 

Thus, every season starts immediately after a cardinal day of the year and ends on the next cardinal day. 

According to Neugebauer : 

"Babylonian astronomy (during Seleucid periods, 300 B.C.-75 A.D. ) was satisfied with an exact four-division of the seasons as far as solstices and equinoxes are concerned, with the summer solstice ( and not the verna! point ) as the fixed point."* 

At a later stage, they however found that the four seasons had unequal lengths ( vide $ 3.1). 

The above definition of 'seasons' has come down to modern astronomy. The Hindu definition of seasons was different ( vide $ 5.6 and 5-A) 

The observation of the Cardinal days of the year appear to have been carried out all over the ancient world by other methods, and often in a far more elaborate manner. People would observe the day-to-day rise of the sun on the eastern horizon, and mark out the days when the sun was farthest north (summer solstice day), or farthest south (winter solstice day). The time period taken by the sun to pass from the southern solstitial point to the northern solstitial point was known in the Vedas as the Uttarāyana (northern passage), and that taken by the sun to pass from the northern solstitial point to the southern solstitial point was known as the Dakṣiṇāyana (southern passage). Exactly midway between these points the sun rises on the vernal and autumnal equinoctial days. From the passage in the Satapatha Brāhmana, quoted later ( vide §5:3), we see clearly that the point on the eastern horizon, where the sun rose on these days, was recognized to be the true east. 

Doubt has been expressed about the ability of Vedic Aryans to make these observations, but to these objections, B. G. Tilak replied in his Orion, pp. 16-17. 

“Prof. Weber and Dr. Schrader appear to doubt the conclusion on the sole ground that we cannot suppose the primitive Aryans to have so far advanced in civilization as to correctly comprehend such problems. This means that we must refuse to draw legitimate inferences from plain facts when such inferences conflict with our precon ceived notions about the primitive Aryan civilization. I am not disposed to follow this method, nor do I think that people, who knew and worked in metals, made clothing of wool, constructed boats, built houses and chariots, performed sacrifices, and had made some advance in agriculture, were incapable of ascertaining the solar and the lunar years. They could not have determined it. correct to a fraction of a second as modern astronomers have done ; but a rough practical estimate was, certainly, not beyond their powers of comprehension." 

The best example of the ability of the ancient people to observe the cardinal points of the sun's motion is afforded by the Stonehenge in the Salisbury plains of England, of which detailed accounts

the book of Job (the Bible) and in Homer. In the last, the star-groups are used by sailors to find out their orientation. Representations of star-groups are found in ancient Babylonian boundary stones of about 1300 B.C. (see Fig. 15). 

. Let us now see how these observations were made. 

Suppose, on a clear moonless evening in early Spring (say March ) and at about 8-30 P.M., we take our stand in a wide field undisturbed by city lights,

have recently appeared in Scientific American ( 188, 6-25, 1953 ) and Discovery (1953, Vol. XIV, p.276). 

It is related in these two publications, that not a long time subsequent to 1800 B.C., say about 1500-1200 B.C., the then inhabitants of Britain, who had not even learnt the use of any metal, but used only stone implements, could construct a huge circular area enclosed by large upright monoliths forming lintels and with a horse-shoe shaped central area having its axis in the direction of sunrise on the summer solstice day. It has been proyed, almost beyond any doubt, that the Stonehenge was used for the ceremonial observation of sunrise on this day. Sir Norman Lockyer in 1900 found that the direction of the axis of the horse-shoe actually makes an angle of about 11° with the present direction of sunrise on the summer solstice day. He did not think that it was a mistake on the part of the original builders ; but that on account of the change in obliquity (angle between equator and ecliptic), the present direction of sunrise had changed to the extent of 11° and using the rate of change of obliquity, he could fix up the time of construction at 1800 + 200 B.C. This estimate has been brilliantly confirmed by C14-analysis of some wood charcoal found in the local burial pits which are presumed to be contemporary with the erection of the Stonehenge. 

After this brilliant confirmation of Lockyer's hypothesis, it is hoped that there will be less hesitation on the part of scholars to admit that it was possible for the Vedic Aryans who knew the use of metal and were far more advanced than the stone-age people of Britain, to devise methods for the observation of the cardinal points of the year. 

How did they observe these points ? Probably in the same way as the Britishers of 1500 B.C., by observing from a central place, the directions of sunrise on the eastern horizon throughout the year. The directions of the solstitial rises could be easily marked. Probably the equinoctial points were found by bisecting the angle between these two directions by means of ropes as described in the Sulva-Sūtras.

##  NIGHT OBSERVATIONS : THE CELESTIAL 

POLE AND THE EQUATOR Almost all ancient nations were familiar with the night-sky either as shepherds, travellers or navigators, and were acquainted with more detailed knowledge of the revolving blue firmament studded with stars than the modern city dweller. The striking constell tions like the Great Bear, the Pleiades, the Orion could not but catch their fancy and references to these star groups are found in ancient literature, in the Vedas, in

In the north, a litile high up to our right hand side we cannot fail to observe the conspicuous constellation of seven stars, called in Europe the Great Bear, but in India, the Saptarsi or seven seers. If we observe the heavens 3 hours later, we shall observe that the group has changed its position as shown in Fig. (8). Let us fix our attention on the two front stars (the pointers) of the Great Bear and join a line through them. The line joining these two stars appear to behave like the hands of a watch, for if produced they pass through a star half as bright at some distance, and appear to have revolved about it as centre. This star is called the Pole Star or Polaris, or Dhruva in Sanskrit which means fixed. If we observe throughout the night, we shall find that the Polaris remains approximately fixed, and the line of pointers continues to go round it. The next day, at

8-26 P.M., nearly 24 hours later they are again almost exactly at the same position. 

We naturally come to the conclusion that the whole starry heavens have been rotating round an axis passing through the observer and the Pole Star from east to west, and the rotation is completed in nearly 24 hours (exactly 23h 56m 48 of mean solar time). 

equator, like the parallels of latitude on the earth, are called parallels of declination. A star's parallel of declination is identical with its diurnal circle, 

The great circles of the celestial sphere, which pass through the poles in the same way as the meridians on the earth, and which are therefore perpendicular to the celestial equator, are called hour-circles. Each star has its own hour-circle, which at the moment when the star passes the north-south line through the zenith of the observer, coincides with the celestial meridian of the place, 

Definition of the Poles The celestial poles, or the poles round which the rotation of the celestial sphere takes place may therefore be defined as those two points in the sky where a star would have no diurnal motion. The exact position of either pole may be determined with proper instruments by finding the centre of the small diurnal circle described by some star near it, as for instance, the stars belonging to the Ursa Minor group. Actually the so-called pole star is at present 57 minutes away from the correct position of the pole which is not actually occupied by any star. 

Since the two poles are diametrically opposite in the sky, only one of them is usually visible from a given place : observers north of the equator see only the north pole, and vice versa in the southern hemisphere. The south pole is not marked by any prominent star. 

Knowing as we now do, that the apparent revolu tion of the celestial sphere is due to the rotation of the earth on its axis, we may also define the poles as the two points where the earth's axis of rotation (or any set of lines parallel to it), produced indefinitely, would pierce the celestial sphere. 

##  THE APPARENT PATH OF THE SUN IN THE SKY 

THE ECLIPTIC The apparent path of the sun in the sky is known in astronomical language as the ecliptic. It is a great circle cutting the celestial equator at an angle of ca 231° (exactly 23° 26' 43" in 1955, but the angle varies from 21° 59' to 24° 36'). This is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. 

The ecliptic is the most important reference circle in the heavens, and let us see how a knowledge of it was obtained in ancient times. 

It is obvious that a knowledge of the stars marking the sun's path could not be obtained directly as in the case of the moon ; for when the sun is up, not even the brightest stars are visible. The knowledge must have been obtained indirectly. Early observers were accustomed to observe the heliacal rising of stars, i.e., observe the brilliant stars lying close to the sun which are on the horizon just before sunrise. This must have given them a rough idea of the stars lying close to .the sun's path. From these observations, as well as from successive appearances of the moon on the first days of the month as narrated in § 4:1, they must have also deduced that the sun was slipping from the west to the east with reference to the fixed stars, and completing a revolution in one year. But how was this path rigorously fixed ? 

It appears that a knowledge of the stars lying on, or close to the moon's path was obtained from observa tions made during lunar, rarely of solar eclipses. 

They must have realized, as narrated in § 4.2, that during a total lunar eclipse, the moon occupies a position in the heavens opposite the sun, and the stars close to the moon, which become visible during totality, approximately mark out points on the sun's path. So the word 'Ecliptic' which means the locus of eclipses, came to denote the sun's path. 

The two points of intersection of the ecliptic with the celestial equator are called.' respectively the

First point of Aries, and the Först point of Libra. The first point of Aries is the ascending node, when the sun passes from the south to the north; the first point of Libra is the descending node, when the sun passes from the north to the south. We have vernal equinox when the sun is at the first point of Aries, summer solstice when the sun is at the first point of Cancer, autumnal equinox when the sun is at the first point of Libra, and winter solstice when the sun is at the first point of Capricorn. To the origin of nomenclature, we return later. 

The celestial equator and the ecliptic are the most important reference planes in astronomy. The positions of all heavenly bodies are given in terms of these planes, taking the first point of Aries as the initial point. We explain below the scientific defini tions of spherical co-ordinates used to denote the position of a body on the celestial globe. 

TC-Celestial longitude 1 

CS=Celestial latitude=B Let PS cut the ecliptic at B. Then 

rB=Polar longitude or dhruvakn=1 

BS = Polar latitude or vikṣepas These last two peculiar co-ordinates, now no long used, were used by the Sūrya Siddhānta to denote sta positions. They have been traced by Neugebauer to Hipparchos five centuries earlier. 

The position of a stellar body may be defined by either its right ascension (a) and declination (8), 

or its celestial longitude(1) and latitude(B). 

The positions of stars in these co-ordinates began to be given from the time of Claudius Ptolemy (150 A.D.) who used them in his Syntaxis. 

##  THE ZODIAC AND THE SIGNS 

The early astronomers must have found that the sun's path in the heavens was almost fixed, while that of the moon, and of the planets, which acquired for astrological reasons great importance from about 1200 B.C., strayed some degrees to the north and south of the ecliptic. 

In case of the moon the deviation from the ecliptic was found to be not much greater than 5°, but some of the planets strayed much more ; in the case of Venus, her perpendicular distance from the ecliptic rises sometimes as high as 80 degrees. So a belt was imagined straying about 9° north and go south of the ecliptic, in which the planets would always remain in course of their movement. This belt came to be known as the 'Zodiac.'

The complete cycle of this belt was divided into 12. equal sectors each of 30°, and each sector called a "Sign'. The signs started with one of the points of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, and the first sign was called 'Aries' after the constellation of stars within it. The names of the succeeding signs are given in Table No. 8 on the next page, in which : 

The first column gives the beginning and ending of the signs, the vernal equinoctial point being taken as the origin.

Ichthues The sixth column gives the Indian names. The seventh column gives the Babylonian names. 

It can be easily inferred from the table that the names are of Babylonian origin, but their exact significance is not always known. It has been assumed that the symbols used to denote the signs have been devised from a representation of the figure of the animal or object after which the sign has been named, for example, the mouth and horns of the Ram, the same of the Bull, and so on. 

It is seen that Varāhamihira's alternative names given in column (5) are simply the Greek names corrupted in course of transmission and as adopted for Sanskrit ; with the exception of the name for Scorpion, which is given as 'Kaurpa'. This has phonetic analogy with the corresponding Babylonian sign name Akrabu for Scorpion. The purely Sanskrit 'names given in column (6) are all translations of Greek naines with the exceptions of : 

(3) Twins, which become Mithuna or ‘Amorous couple', 

(9) the Archer, which becomes the 'Bow', (10) the Goat, which becomes the 'Crocodile', 

(11) Water bearer, which becomes the 'Waterpot'. Some of them appear to have been translations of Babylonian names. 

The Babylonian names, as interpreted by Ginzel* are given in the seventh column, with their meanings. 

It is thus seen that the names of the zodiacal signs are originally of Babylonian origin. They were taken over almost without change by the Greeks, and subsequently by the Romans, and the Hindus, from Graeco-Chaldean astrology, 

* Ginzel, Handbuch der Mathematischen und Technischen Chrono logie, Vol. I, p. 84. 

But why was such an odd assortment of animal names chosen for the Signs'? There have been interesting speculations. The reader may consult Brown's Researches into the Origin of the Primilive Constellations of the Grecks, Phoenicians and Babylonians, London, 1900. 

These signs were taken up by almost all nations in the centuries before the Christian era on account of the significance attached to them by astrologers. In Greece, they were first supposed to have been introduced by the early Greek astronomer Cleostratos, an astronomer who observed about 532 B.C. in the island of Tenedos off the Hellespont who introduced the designation 'Zodiac' to describe the belt of stars about the ecliptic. The twelve 'Zodical Signs' are not known in older ritualistic Indian literature like the Brāhmaṇas. They appear to have come to India in the wake of the Macedonian Greeks or of nations like the Sakas who were intermediaries for trans mission of Greek culture to India. 

Confusion in the starting point of the Zodiac 

The 'Initial Point' of the zodiac should be the Vernal Point or the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, but as will be shown in the next section, this point is not fixed, but moves west-ward along the ecliptic at the rate of approximately 50" per year (precession of the equinoxes). This motion is unidirectional, but before Newton proved it to be so in 1687 from dynamics and the law of gravitation, there was no unanimity even amongst genuine astronomers about the uni-directional nature of precessional motion, inspite of overwhelming observational 

evidences. 

194 

The hesitation of the medieval astronomers in accepting precession can be easily understood. Most of them earned their livelihood by practising the 'Astrological Cult which was reared on the basis that the signs of the zodiac are fixed, and coincident with certain star-groups ; but this assumption crumbles to the ground if precession is accepted. But as historical records now show, though astronomers 'had clearly recognized that the initial point should be the point of intersection of the equator and the ecliptic, there was no unanimity even amongst ancient astronomers of different ages regarding the location of this point in the heavens, because it was not occupied by any prominent star at any epoch and the ancients were unaware of the importance of its motion (vide § 4:9). 

The attention of mankind was drawn in remote antiquity to the five star-like bodies : 

Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn and Mercury. Venus and Jupiter and occasionally Mars are more brilliant than ordinary stars. Sooner or later, it was found that while the ordinary stars remain fixed on the revolving heavens these five stars creep along them, as a modern author puts it, 'like gloro-worms on a whirling globe', each in its own way. Venus appears as a morning and evening star, the maximum elongation being 47o. It early drew the attention of sea-faring people, its appearance on the eastern horizon indicating early sunrise to persons on lonely seas. But it took mankind some time to discover that it was the same luminary which appeared for some period as a morning star, then as an evening star. Its brilliance could not but strike the imagination of mankind. Mercury also appears regularly as morning and evening star, and it must have been discovered later than Venus, but still at such a remote age in antiquity that all traces of its discovery are lost. 

The motion of the brilliant luminary, Jupiter across the sky attracted early attention ; Mars

Planetary Astrology took the world by the storm after 300 B.C. and its influence was strongest during middle ages in Europe, till the rise of rationalism and modern science almost completely undermined this influence.

By placiog the sun at the centre and having the earth and the other planets revolve in circles around it, Copernicus (1473-1543) was able to explain the backward motion of the planets among the stars much more simply than in the Ptolemaic system. This is illustrated in the above figure, taken from Pictorial Astronomy, in the case of Mars as seen from the earth. The earth's speed is 184 miles a second while that of Mars is only 15 miles & second. As the earth overtakes Mars, the latter seems to move backward. The direct motion of Mars to the east is shown at positions 1, 2 and 3, backward or retrograde motion to the 

West at 4 and 5, and direct motion to the east again at 6 and 7. 

What was the reason for the strong fascination which man has for astrology ? 

Mankind has always a psychological weakness for omina, i.e., some signs which can predict future events, good or bad. The older form of omina were rather crude, viz., flight of certain birds like the crow, or movements of animals like the jackal or the snake, howlings of certain birds and animals. In many countries, sheep and goats were sacrificed to gods on the eve of great enterprises, and Augurs claimed to be able to interpret the intentions of the gods from an examination of lines and convolutions on the liver of the sacrificial animal ( Hepatoscopy ). Meteorological phenomona such as a lightning discharge, haloes round the moon, aurora were also regarded as ‘omens'. 

The older forms of omina were all apparently very crude compared to planetary omina which gradually 

"Mars stands in Scorpio, turns and goes forth with diminished brilliancy"; "Saturn has appeared in the Lion" ; "Mars approached Jupiter"; and so on. 

There is not a trace of scientific interest in these texts ; the mind of the reporters is entirely occupied by the omens : When such or such happens, 

“it is lucky for the king, may lord”; or, "copious foods will come" ; "there will be devastation" ; "the crops will be diminished”; "the king will be besieged" ; "the enemy will be slain" ; 

there will be raging of lions and wolves" ; "the gods intend Akkad for happiness" ; 

and so on. 

Yet, with all those observations, these reports represent is considerable astronomical activity. For the first time in history a large number of data on the planets had been

The huge temples, called Ziggurats, ruins of which have been found in Mesopotamia, are supposed to have been dedicated to the planetary gods, each storey being assigned to a particular god. It was the duty of temple priests to keep the planets under observation, and record their positions on the only writing material available then viz., člay-tablets. Hundreds of thousands such clay tablets have been discovered in the ruins of Ziggurats, royal palaces and libraries, and patiently interpreted by western scholars like Kugler. .

Regularities were not sought for ; but regularities imposed themselves, without giving surprise. They aroused certain expectations. Expectation is the first unconscious form of generalized knowledge, like all technical knowledge in daily life growing out of practical experience. Then gradually the expectation develops into prediction, an indication that the rule, the regularity, has entered consciousness. In the celestial phenomena the regularities appear as fixed periods, after which the same aspects return. Knowledge of the periods was the first form of astronomical theory».*

This explanation has been found by 

O. Neugebauer (vide his Exact Sciences in Antiquity). Most of these data were known to Hipparchos and also to Geminus, a Greek astronomer, who flourished about 70 B.C.

Probably the first stage was to determine the angular distance of heavenly bodies from some 'Normal Stars' as indicated by Sachs.

was obtained, are not yet known with precision. Only some guesses can be made. 

The early astronomers probably observed that the bright stars Regulus (α Leonis ), Spica (α Virginis), the conspicuous group Pleiades, and certain fainter stars a Librae, a Scorpii were almost on the sun's path. The ecliptic could be roughly constructed by joining these stars. 

'Regulus' or α Leonis was the 'Royal Star' in Babylonian mythology. In Indian classics, it is known as Maghā (or the Great ) and the presiding deity is Indra, the most powerful Vedic god. It is almost exactly on the ecliptic. Citrā ( or α Virginis ) is 2° to : the south. 

The First Point of Aries :-The first point of Aries is the fiducial point from which all astronomical measurements are made. But how was this point, or any other cardinal point, say the first point of Cancer. ( summer solstice ), the first point of Capricornus. ( winter solstice ) and the first point of Libra, were located on the circle of the ecliptic in early, times ? 

For rarely have the first point of Aries nor any other of the cardinal points been occupied by prominent stars during historical times. Even if for measurement, the ancient astronomers used some kind of astrono mical instrument, say the armillary sphere, it would be difficult for them to locate the first point of Aries correct within a degree.

The Sassanid Persians also followed their own solar calendars inherited from Acheminid times. But the elements of the Chaldean luni-solar calendar have been used in a limited way, for the Christian ecclesiastic calendar for Christianity arose in Palestine and Syria, and the most important event in Christ's life, His crucifixion, is recorded in terms of the luni-solar calendar prevalent in Palestine about the first century A.D.

##  GREEK CONTRIBUTION TO ASTRONOMY 

The ancient astronomers were interested primarily in the moon and the planets but later about 150 B.C., Hipparchos gives lists of fixed stars as well with their positions. 

It was clearly observed that though these planets keep near the ecliptic, they deviate by small amounts sometimes to the north, sometimes to the south. In the case of the moon, the maximum deviation amounts to nearly 50 (inclination of the moon's orbit to the ecliptic). In the case of planets, excepting in the case of Mercury and Venus, the deviation was not large. 

In the case of the moon, a knowledge of the moon's celestial latitude was necessary for prediction of eclipses and therefore both the celestial longitude and latitude used to be recorded by the Chaldean astro nomers of the Seleucidean period. In the case of planets, only the celestial longitude appear to have been used. 

The Chaldean astronomers were the first to frame lunar and planetary ephemerides (i.e. calculation in advance of lunar and planetary positions—the pre cursor of modern Nautical Almanacs and Ephemerides) from about 500 B.C. But during these times, neither the knowledge of the sphere nor of spherical or plane trigonometry had developed. The Chaldeans had only developed the ideas of angular measurement which they expressed in degrees, minutes and seconds, the whole circle being divided into 360° degrees. Their methods, which have been elucidated by Neugebauer, Sachs and others were arithemetical. They took maximum and minimum values of astrono- nomical quantities, and interpolated for an inter mediate period, assuming the change to be linear (zigzag function, vide Neugebauer, Exact Sciences in 

Antiquity, Chap. V, Babylonian Astronomy). 

It was the Greeks who introduced geometrical methods to deal with positions of heavenly bodies, and made the next great advance in astronomy. But they developed trigonometry only to a rudimentary stage vide 8 4.8). But they also used Babylonian arithmetical methods alternately. Thus while Ptolemy uses the trigonometric chord functions in bis Syntaxis, in the astrological text, called Tetrabiblos, he uses the Babylonian arithmetical methods. 

Though the calendar, as we have seen, gave the first stimulus for the cultivation of the astronomical 

It has been considered neccessary to give a short account of Greek contributions to astronomy, because there is a widespread view that it was Grezk astro nomy which formed the basis of calendar reform in India which took place about 400 A.D. ( Siddhānta Jyotiṣa calendar). Let us see how far this view is correct. The Greeks themselves appear to have made no use of astronomy for the reform of their own calendars, as was done later in India. They cultivated astronomy partly as pure science, partly as an indispensable adjunct to astrology. 

It is now well-known that Greek civilization had a long past going back to at least 1500 B.C. The remains of this civilization have been found in Crete (Minoan), and on the Greek mainland itself (Mycenean). Inscriptions have been found in strange scripts (Linear A, and B) which defied decipherment till 1952. We have therefore as yet no knowledge of the calendar in the Mycenean age of Greece (1400 B.C.—1000 B.C.). but probably they will now be forthcoming. 

The Homeric poems 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey' written about 900 B.C., as well as Hesiod writing about 700 B.C. show considerable acquaintance of stars and constellations needed for sea-faring people, to find out their orientation when out at sea. 

From about 750 B.C., the Greek city-states began to emerge ; they were engaged in maritime trade over the whole Mediterranean basin. These activities brought them into contact with many older nations who had attained a high standard of civilization, ë.g., the Egyptians, the nations of the Near East, vex., the Lydians, the Phoenicians, and the Assyrians and imbibed many elements of their civilization. The older Greek scholars themselves admit that the Greeks 

ere 

202 

borrowed tþeir script* from the Phoenicians, their coinage from the Lydians, their preliminary ideas of geometry from the Egyptians and of astronomy from the Chaldeans. But they enriched all these sciences beyond measure by their own original thoughts and contributions. As Plato (428-348 B.C.) proudly remarks : "...whatever the Greeks acquire from foreigners, is turned by them into something nobler." 

Greek science goes no further back than Thales of Miletus (624-548 B.C.), who is reckoned to be the first of the seven sages of Greece. Considerable knowledge of astronomy and physics was ascribed to him by later writers. He is supposed to have predicted the occurrence of an almost total solar eclipse, which occurred on May 28, 585 B.C., on the basis of his knowledge of the Chaldean Saros. These stories are now disbelieved by scholars well versed in Assyriology, for according to their finding, the Chaldeans them selves before 400 B.C., had no knowledge of the Saros of 18 years 10% days used later to predict the eclipses, but they used other methods with only partial success. Thales might have used one of these methods, but not certainly the Chaldean Saros. Considering the crude state of Greek civilization in Thales' times, these scholars think that it is a fairytale of modern times that Thales knew anything about the Saros. Thales lived in a coastal city of Asia Minor which had active contact with the great civilizations of the Near East, and probably much of the knowledge ascribed to him were picked up from Babylon and Egypt. 

The next figure in Greek astronomy is Anaximander, (610-545 B.C.), likewise of Miletus a junior contem porary of Thales, who is said to have introduced the . use of the gnomon ( vide 43). This may be conceded, .but this practice was derived most probably from the Chaldeans, who used the gnomon from much earlier times.. Cleostratos ( 530 B.C.) of Tenedos was cited by later authors to have introduced the knowledge of the zodiac, of the eight-year cycle of intercalations in Greece, but probably he merely transmitted the Babylonian knowledge and practice. Meton of Athens is said to have introduced the nineteen-year cycle of 7 intercalary months in Athens in 432 B.C., but as remarked earlier, its use in Greek calendars cannot be dated before 342 B.C., though it was known in Babylon from at least 383 B.C. The question of priority of this discovery is still to be decided, probably by fresh finds and interpretation of ancient astronomical recordin' 

* It appears that the Greeks of Homeric poems used linear A and B, but about 900 B.C., they borrowed the simpler Phoenician script and' adopted it to their use by the addition of vowels. Therekiy they forgot their old script and history, which became myth and legend. The decipherment of Minoan Linear B has been. achieved in 1952 by Ventris and Chadwick. 

We have besides philosophers of the: Pythagorian school (500-300 B. C.), a religious brotherhood which cultivated geometry, astronomy, physics and mathematics. . They are cited by later writers to have propagated the view that the earth. was a sphere, and the planets were also spherical bodies like the earth, but it is difficult to state when, and on what grounds these theories were first propounded. 

These were the periods of tutelage. Greek genius in astronomy began to flower only after 400 B.C., and was aided by a number of causes. 

The first was the development of geometry as a science by philosophers of the Pythagorean school (500-300 B. C.), and other scholars, notably Hippocrates of Chios ( 450-430 B.C.), and. Democritos of Abdera ( 460-370 B.C.). A great impetus to both plane and solid geometry was given by Plato ( 428 348 B.C.), famous philosopher and founder of a school of studies and research known to the world as the Academy'. Plato counted amongst his contem poraries and juniors several geometers of distinction, vix., Archytas of Tarentum (first half of fourth century B.C.), Theaitetus of Athens (c. 380 B.C.), Eudoxus of Cnidos ( d. 355 B.C.), and several others. All th: geometrical knowledge developed by these and other scholars was compiled, and rewritten into a. logical system with rich contributions of his own by Euclid, who lived in the Museum of Alexandria ( 280 B.C.), and was bequeathed to the world in thirteen (or fifteen ) books known as the Elements of Euclid, which have remained to this day the basis of the teaching of elementary geometry. There is no other book of science which have remained current and authoritative for such a long stretch of time, now extending over two thousand years. 

The second factor was political. During the sixth and fifth centuries before Christ, the Greek savants and scholars had indeed undertaken educational journeys to the Near East in search of knowledge --journeys which were made possible and safe under the orderly regime of the Acheminid empire (Persian). But it was the conquest of the Persian empire by Alexander of Macedon in 330 B.C., which rendered these contacts easier and more fruitful. The Greek successor dynasties, vix., the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt, and the Seleucid dynasty in Babylon and other dynasties in Asia Minor were all great patrons of learning and encouraged and maintained scholars ; the former set up the famous Museum at Alexandria, which was. a research institution with a great library, an observatory and other necessary equipment. It attracted scholars from all parts of Greater Greece and provided them with free board, lodge and a salary. This place nurtured a number of great Greek,geniuses :

Euclid; already mentioned ; Eratosthenes who first measured correctly the diameter of the earth and was the founder of scientific chronology ; and others whom we shall meet presently. 

On the Asiatic side, under the centralized rule of the Seleucids, the later Chaldean and Greek astrono mical efforts became very much intermingled. A Chaldean priest, Berossus, who lived during the reign of the second Seleucidean king Antiochos Soter ( 282-261 B.C. ), translated into Greek the standard Chaldean works on astronomy and astrology. The period from 340 B.C. to 150 A.D. may be called the most flourishing period of astronomical studies in antiquity. The Chaldeans figured prominently during the earlier part of this period but their methods were based on a primitive form of algebra and arithmetic. According to Neugebauer, their contri butions in mathematics and astronomy were as good as those of the contemporary Greeks who used geometry, but they gradually faded into obscurity on account of their infatuation with astrology ; and the Greeks, though they were great believers in astrology, freed themselves at least from astrolatry, and cultivated astronomy as part of astrology, and emerged as leaders in astronomical science. 

The earliest Greek astronomer to use geometrical ideas in astronomy is, if we leave aside the Pytha goreans, probably Eudoxus of Cnidos ( d. 355 B.C.), a junior contemporary, friend and pupil of Plato. He made great original discoveries in geometry, and Books V and VI of Euclid are ascribed to him. It was probably his knowledge of geometry which led him to make the first scientific attempt to give a geometrical explanation for the irregular motions of the sun, the moon, and the planets. Twenty-seven spheres, all concentric to the earth were needed to account for these motions. This theory had but a short life, but it is remarkable as the first instance, when heavenly bodies, connected with great gods, were treated on a human level. 

Eudoxus is supposed to be the inventor of geometrical methods for determining the sizes and distances of the sun and the moon, usually ascribed to Aristarchus of Samos (fl. 280 B.C.), who is known to have taught that the daily revolution of the celestial sphere was due to the rotation of the earth round its axis. He is also said to have first put forward the heliocentric theory of the universe. Neither of these theories was accepted the contemporary astronomers. The world had to wait for the appearance of a Coper nicus (1473-1543), for the acceptance of these views. 

Apollonius of Perga (born avout 262 B.C.). kpown more for his treatise on Conics, originated the theory 

of epicycles, and eccentrics to account for planetary motion. He was a júnior contemporary of two great figures : Eratosthenes already mentioned and Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 B.C.), a great. figure in mechanics, hydrostatics and other sciences, but to astronomy, he is remembered as originator of the idea of Planetarium-a revolving open sphere with internal mechanisms with which he could imitate the motions of the sun, the moon, and the five planets. 

Archimedes is also credited with attempts for finding out the actual distances of the planets from the earth. We do not know whether this is correct or not, but about this time, we find the planets arranged accord ing to the order of their distances from the earth : 

Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn or if we take the reverse order : 

Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. This last order was taken up by astrology and formed the basis of the seven-day week, which came into vogue about the first century A.D. 

. The greatest name in Greek astronomy is Hipparchos of Nicaea, in Bithynia who settled in the island of Rhodes and had an observatory there (f. 161-127 B.C.). He probably corresponded with the savants at the Museum of Alexandria. Not much of his writings have come down to us, except through quotations and remarks by Claudius Ptolemy, the famous Alexandrian astronomer who flourished three centuries later. Sarton writes about Hipparchos : 

"It is possible that all the Ptolemaic instruments, except the mural quadant, had already been invented by him (e.g. diopter, parallactic and meridian instruments). He was the first Groek observer who divided the circles of his instru ments into 360 degrees. Ho constructed the first celestial 

globe on record. 

He used and probably invented the stereographic projection. He made an immense number of astronomical observations with amazing accuracy" 

The principle of measurement of angles was certainly derived from the Chaldeans. Hipparchos gave 'à catalogue of 850 stars with their positions, which is reproduced in Ptolemy's Syntaxis. Vogt found that of the 471 preserved numbers giving position, 64.are declinations, 67 are right ascensions, 340 are in polar longitudes and latitudes, which reappear in the Surya Siddhānta, six hundred years later. 

It is suggested that after his discovery of precession (vide § 4.9 ), Hipparchos probably used celestial longi tudes and latitudes. But these co-ordinates bad been already used by the Chaldeans at least a century earlier, 

Hipparchos, had probably some knowledge of plane and spherical trigonometry necessary for the solution 

C. R. – 34 

204 

of astronomical problems, e. g., finding out the time of rise of zodiacal signs during the year, a problem of great importance to horoscopic astrology. It is the current opinion that he used the double chord, illustrated below : 

Chord (2 a)=2 R Sin a 

R 

Fig. 20 and gave a table of double-chords from 0° to 90°, which was later improved by Ptolemy in his Syntaxis. It is suggested by Neugebauer, that the 'Sine function' (Jya in Hindu astronomy) was introduced 600 years later by Aryabhaṭa, and replaced the double chord. The Hindu astronomers used Utkramajyā which is the ver sine function, 1-cos a, but do not appear to hate used the cosine function as such. Neither the Greeks nor the Hindus used the tangent, and the cotangent, which were introduced by Arab astronomers about the ninth century (al-Battānı, 858-929 A.D.), and were known in Latin in early days as Umbra Versa, and Umbra Extensa (extent of shadow ) respectively. These are reminiscent of the practice of designating the zenith distance Z of the sun by the length 1 of the shadow of the gnomon, l=p tan 2, p being the height of the gnomon. 

Between Hipparchos and Claudius Ptolemy (150 A.D.), who lived at the Alexandrian Museum from 128 A.D. to 151 A.D., there is a gap of 300 years, which saw the phenomenal rise of horoscopic astrology. There are, however, very few great names in astronomy. Menelaos, a Greek astronomer who lived in Rome about 98 A.D., laid the foundation of spherical trigonometry, but it was confined to a transversal proposition from which Ptolemy deduced solutions for only right angled spherical triangles, of which either two sides or an angle and one side are given. The Hindu astronomers likewise used only solutions of right angled spherical triangles. The discovery of general relations in spherical triogenometry was the work of Arabic astronomers (al-Battani). 

Claudius Ptolemy who worked at Alexandria between 128-151 A.D., was, as Sarton says, a man of the Euclidean type. Great equally as an astronomer, mathematician, geographer, physicist, and chronologist, his main work is the great mathematical and astro Domical treatise known in Greek as 'Syntaxis', and in 

Arabic translation as the Almagest. It has been long supposed that it rendered all previous treatises in astronomy obsolete, and remained a standard text, which fertilized the brains of all ancient and medieval astronomers, Greek, Jew, Arab, and European, till the rise of the heliocentric theory of the universe rendered it obsolete. This opinion appears to have been rather exaggerated. Strangely enough, the Syntaxis appears to have been quite unknown to Hindu astronomers of the 5th century A.D. 

Ptolemy's chief contribution to astronomy was his elaborate theory of planetary motion and discovery of a second inequality in the motion of the moon, now called. Evection. He gave a catalogue of 1028 stars with their positions, most of which have been shown to have been taken from Hipparchos by adding 30 to the longitudes given by him. This represents the shift of the first point of Aries since Hipparchos's time according to Ptolemy's calculation. The actual value is 4o. 

Ptolemy wrote a treatise on astrology known as the “Tetrabiblos" which long remained the Bible of the astrologers. 

After Ptolemy, there were no great figure in astronomy except few commentators and workers of mediocre ability like Theon of Alexandria (about 370 A.D.), who initiated the false theory of trepidation of the equinoxes, and Paulus of Alexandria (fl. 378 A.D.) who wrote an 'astrological introduction. He is supposed to have been the inspirer of the Indian Siddhānta known as 'Paulisa' Siddhānta (vide § 56), but this hypothesis started by Alberuni has never been proved. With the advent of Christianty, and after murder of the learned Hypatia (415 A.D.), the 'light' goes out of Greece. 

The Greek contributions to astronomy are : 

A geocentric theory of the universe, with the planets in the order given on page 203. 

The treatment of planets as spherical bodies similar to the earth. 

Geometrization of astronomy, development of the concepts of the equator, the ecliptic and of spherical co-ordinates (right ascension and declination, celestial latitude and longitude), some elementary know ledge of plane and spherical trigometry to deal with astronomical problems. 

Knowledge of planetary orbits, and attempts to explain them with the aid of epicyclic theories.

##  DISCOVERY OF THE PRECESSION OF 

THE EQUINOXES 

In the previous sections, we have stated how the Chaldean and Greek astronomers started giving 

CALENDARIO ASTRONOMY 

205 

but is subject to variations which we may disregard at this stage. The shift is accumulative and in 100 years would amount to 1° 24', and in about 26000 years the first point will go completely round the ecliptic. The period depends upon certain factors and is not constant. 

The tropical year, or the year which decides the recurrence of seasons, is the time-interval for the return of the sun in its orbit, starting from the year's vernal equinoctial point to the next vernal equinoctial 

tropical year would be the same as the sidereal year, which is the same as the time of revolution of the earth in its orbit. But since the vernal equinoctial point slips to the west, the sun has to travel 360° 0' 01-50" =359° 59' 10" to arrive at the new vernal equi noctial point, hence the duration of the tropical year is less than that of the sidereal year by about 20 minutes. In exact terms : duration of the sidereal year = 365.25636 mean solar days 

, , tropical. = 365.24220 at the present time. 

Further Consequences of the Precession 

of the Equinoxes We may now consider some consequences of the 

positions of planets, and stars, with the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator—the first point of Aries-as the fiducial point. We shall now relate how the discovery was made that this point is not fixed in the heavens, but has a slow motion along the ecliptic to the west at the rate of ca. 50" per year. The rate is very small, but as it is unidirec tional and cumulative, it is of immense importance to astronomy, and incidentally is very damaging to astrology. 

When the sun, in course of its yearly journey arrives at the first point of Aries, we have the vernal equinox. The first point of Aries is therefore also called the vernal point. 

The position of the vernal point has rarely in the course of history, been occupied by a prominent star, but in India, as narrated in § 5:4, its nearness to star groups as well as the nearness 'of other cardinal points to star-groups have been noted from very early times. Traditions of different epochs record different stars as being near to the cardinal points. But nobody appeard to have drawn any conclusion from these records (vide for details § 5:4). 

In Babylon also, different sets of positions of stars and planets record Aries 15°, Aries 10°, and Aries 8° (the zero is of Ptolemy's) as being the vernal point. But no Chaldean astronomer to our knowledge appears to have drawn any conclusion from these data. 

The first astronomer known to have drawn attention to the precession of the equinoxes was Hipparchos. He particularly mentions that the distance of the bright star Spica (α Virginis or Citrā). has shifted by 2o from the autumnal equinoctial point since the time of his predecessor Timocharis who observed at Alexandria about 280 B.C. He concluded that the autumnal point, and therefore also the vernal point, was moving westward at the rate of 511 seconds per year. 

• It is not known whether Hipparchos considered the motion as unidirectional. It was impossible for him to say anything definite on this point, as obeservations extending over centuries are required to enable one to make a definite statement on this point. 

Though Hipparchos made, as time showed, one of the greatest astronomical discoveries of all times, which is all-important for the calendar, as well as for astronomy, its great importance does not appear to have been realized by either his contemporaries or followers for thousands of years. 

Let us, therefore, dwell a little on the consequences of this discovery.' Later and more accurate observa tions have shown that the rate is nearly 50° per year, 

Hipparchos appears first to have marked out the 

· beginning of the astronomical first point of Aries. It started go west of the star a Arietis. Ptolemy had found that it had shifted by his time by about 30, and gave the rate of precession as 36" per year. In this, he was wrong, the true shift being about 4'. Ptolemy in his 'Uranometry' gives the starting point of the sign of Aries as 6° to the west of ß Arietis, and the other constellations' marked at intervals of 30° may be marked out on the zodiac. The picture (Fig. 19) gives the boundaries of the different signs according to Hipparchos. The boundaries of the signs of Ptolemy would be 4o to the west of those of Hipparchos. 

By the time of Ptolemy, (and probably much earlier), a complex system of astrology had developed which connected men's destiny in life with the position of planets in the different signs at the time of his birth (horoscopy). It was claimed that even 

calculated in advance from planetary positions in the signs. Though a few rational men like Seneca and Cicero were as much sceptical about the claims of astrology as the modern man, the general mass became converted to its claims, even astronomers not excepted. Even the great Ptolemy wrote a treatise "The-Tetrabiblos' exposing the principles of Astrology. 

206 

·In fact, belief in astrology was one of the main incentives for the observation of the positions of heavenly bodies in ancient and medieval times which were carried out by medieval astronomers with so much zeal under the willing patronage of influential persons. 

The discovery of precession is very disconcerting to astrologers, for in the astrological lore, the signs are identified with certain fixed star-clusters ; whereas precession tends to take them entirely out of these star-clusters. Thus since Hipparchos's time, the shift has been nearly 30 degrees, and what was the sign of Pisces in Hipparchos's time has now become the sign of Aries, and the astronomical sign of Aries has now nothing to do with the Aries constellation, 

This consequence must have been foreseen by the followers of Ptolemy, and they probably started, more on psychological than on scientific grounds, to find out theories to mitigate the devastating influence of precession on astrology. Astronomers immediately following Ptolemy barely mentioned precession. It was first referred to by Theon of Alexandria (ca. 370 A.D.) who invented the theory of Trepidation, i.e., he said that the precessional motion was not unidirec tional, but oscillatory. He gave the amplitude of oscillation as 8o. Probably this figure was suggested 

\- Ptolemy's Almagest into Arabic ; he noted precession, 

but upheld the theory of trepidation. But the other great Arabic astronomers like al-Fargbani (861 Baghdad), al-Battāni (858-Syria), Abd al-Rabanān al-ṣafi (903-986-Teheran) and Ibn Yonus (d. 1009– Cairo), all noted precession and rejected the theory of trepidation. In fact al-Battani gave the rate of precession as 54" per year, which is far more correct than the rate given by Ptolemy, viz., 36" per year. 

But unfortunately, Europe recovering from the slumbers of dark ages were more influenced by the Spanish-Muslim astronomers al-Zarquali (1029-1087 of Cordova). and al-Bitruji (ca. 1150, living at Seville), who upheld. the theory of trepidation. As their influence was considerable, they were largely responsible for its diffusion among the Muslim, Jewish and Christian astronomers, so much so that Johann Werner (1522) and Copernicus himself (1543) were still accepting it ; Tycho Brahe and Kepler had doubts concerning the continuity and regularity of the precession, but they finally rejected the trepidation. The theory of trepidation was completely given up in Europe after 1687, when Newton gave a physical explanation of it from dynamics and the law of gravitation. This is given in appendix (4-A), for the benefit of Indian astrologers and almanac-makers who still believe in the theory of trepidation and oppose reform of the wrong calendar they are using for centuries. 

Sarton from whose writings much of this account has been compiled, writes* :: 

"The persistence of the false theory of trepidation is difficult to understand. At the very beginning of our era, the time span of the observations was still too small to measure the procession with precision and without ambiguity, but as the centuries passed there could not remain any ambiguity. Between the stellar observations registered in the Almagest and those that could be made by Copernicus, almost fifteen centuries had elapsed, and the difference of longitudes would amount to 210" 

Aries had shifted by a little less than 80 from Hipparchos's position, and Theon thought that it would go back and save astrology. 

Proclos the successor (410-485. A.D.), head of the Platonic Academy at Athens, a very learned man and one of the founders of Neoplatonism, denied the existence of precession! 

After the sixth century A.D, the dark age set in Europe and the mantle of scientific investigation fell on the Hindus and the Arabs. Let us see how the Arab astronomers regarded the precession.

the top falls down ; the processional motion of the top is due to the pull exerted by the gravity. 

Now turning to the earth, we see that as a first approximation, wo may take it as a point of mass concentrated at the centre, and then deduce its orbit as is done in classical planetary theory. This would have been all right, if the earth wero a homogeneous sphere. But the earth is not & sphere, but a spheroid, having its polar axis shorter than the equatorial axis by 43 kms. (= 27 miles). There is an oquatorial bulge of matter. The pull due to the sun, is now equivalent to a force in the ecliptic passing through the centre of the earth defining the orbital motion, plus a couple, which tends to turn the equator of the earth into the plane of the ocliptic. It is this couple which produces precessional motion. 

For details of calculation the reader may refer to a book on Rigid Dynamics, say A. Webster, Dynamics, pp. 298-302. 

We mention only the results here :

we get the progressive part of the solar precession 

=246 10–18, 

This is in radians per second of time. To convert it to seconds of arc per year, we have to multiply the expression by 2.063 x 108 x 3.156 X 10". 

2.063 X 10% being the number of seconds of angle in a radian, and 3.156 x 107 the number of seconds of 

time in the year. We have therefore the rate of solar precession 

=16."0 por year. We have now to calculate the action of the moon which, in spite of its much smaller mass, exerts & far larger perturbing force as the lunar distance is much smaller. In fact the tide raising force (mm) for the moon is more than double that of the sun. This makes the rate of lunar precession=34".4 per year. 

But there is another complication. The moon's orbit is not coincident with he sun's path (ecliptic) but is inclined at an average angle of 5° 9', the extreme values being 5° 19' and 4° 59'. Further the points of intersection of the moon's orbit with the ecliptic travel round the ecliptic in a period of 18.6 years. The pole of the moon's orbit M therefore moves round the pole of the ecliptic C as shown in fig. 24 in a period of 18.6 years. The lunar precessional angle Won has therefore to be defined from the instantaneous position of M. 

Combination of the two precessional motions. 

The two precessions can be combined as in fig. 24. Hero C, M are the polés of the ecliptic and of the moon's orbit: P is the celestial pole. The solar procession can bio

\------F....---R 

Annual Rate of Precessional Motion 

The solar and lunar processions amount to 50.937 per tropical year, with a very small centurial variation. After making necessary corrections for the slight motion of the plane of the ecliptic due to attraction of planets, the annual rate of general procession in longitude is obtained as follows : 

Rate of procession=50."2564+0."0222 T per trop. year, where T=Tropical centuries after 1900 A.D. 

The putation in longitudo may amount to +17.''2 according to different positions of the lunar node, but its effect on the annual rate of precession does not exceed £5."8, so that the actual precession rate per year may vary between 44."5 to 56."0. 

The average rate of annual precession is not constant, it is very slowly increasing. The annual rate for certain epochs along with the period taken by the equinoxes to move through 1°, are however stated below :
