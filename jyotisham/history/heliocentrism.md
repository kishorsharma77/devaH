## Aitreya Brāhmaṇa 2.7 1kBCE or older
- "The (sun) never really sets or rises. In that they think of him “He is setting", having reached the end of the day, he inverts himself; thus he makes evening below, day above. Again in that they think of him “He is rising in the morning”, having reached the end of the night he inverts himself; thus he makes day below, night above. He never sets; indeed he never sets." 
- Subhash kAk on this passage: "One way to visualize it is to see the universe as the hollow of a sphere so that the inversion of the sun now shines the light on the world above ours. But this is impossible since the sun does move across the sky during the day and if the sun doesn't set or rise it doesn't move either. Clearly, the idea of “inversion" denotes nothing but a movement of the earth."

## Aryabhata 500 AD
- "Aryabhata (born in 476 AD. ) appears to have held the view that the **stars did not revolve round the earth, but the latter revolved round itself** and gave the illustration of a man sitting in a moving boat feeling that it is the stationary objects on the banks that rush past in the opposite direction. ... This was more than eleven hundred years before Galileo and there is nothing to show that Aryabhata suffered in the least for his views."- PV Kane
- In the words of Thurston: "Not only did Aryabhaṭa believe that the earth rotates, but there are glimmerings in his system (and other similar Indian systems) of a possible underlying theory in which the earth (and the planets) orbits the sun, rather than the sun orbiting the earth. The evidence is that the basic planetary periods are relative to the sun. For the outer planets this is not significant: both earth and sun are inside their orbits and so the time taken to go round the earth and the time taken to go round the sun are the same. The significant evidence comes from the inner planets: the period of the śīghrocca is the time taken by the planet to orbit the sun." 
- "Aryabhata held that earth was a sphere and rotated on its axis, and that the eclipses were not the work of Rāhu but caused by the shadow of the earth falling on the moon. Both these views were rejected and severely condemned by later astronomers like VarAhamihira and Brahmagupta."
- Al Beruni's mis-characterization - "Al bIrUni accepts that spherical part. He (al bIrUnI) says he wrote a work arguing against a moving earth and in favor of geocentricity."

## sUryasiddhAnta
- Earth is said to be a stationary globe around which sun, moon and five planets orbit.
  - "Thus everywhere on [the surface of] the terrestrial globe, people suppose their own place higher [than that of others], yet this globe is in space where there is no above nor below." —Surya Siddhanta, XII.53

## Brahmagupta 628 CE
- In his Brahmasiddhanta or Brahmasphutasiddhanta he has found fault with Aryabhata's
theory about the diurnal motion of the earth in the following verse :  "प्राणेनैति कलां भूर् यदि तर्हि कुतो व्रजेत् कम् अध्वानं । आवर्तनम् उर्व्यश् चेन् न पतन्ति समुच्छ्रयाः कस्मात् ॥"

## varAhamihira ~600CE
- "The Pancasiddhantika (13. 6) of Varahamihira refers to this+++(AryabhaTa's)+++ view and rejects it, not on the ground that it is opposed to the Veda, but on the ground that, if that view were correct, hawks and other birds flying high up in the sky would not be able to come back to their nests without fail He did not know that the atmosphere also goes with the earth. "- PV Kane

## bhAgavata-purANa
- Geocentric, flat earth model. Example: 5.21.8 - [VB](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/5/21/8-9/). Zero calculations. Best treated as kavi-samaya type arthavAda.
- Modern visualizations - [SD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELKxRPHR6U).
- "The Srimad-Bhagavatam’s mode of presentation is very different from the familiar modern approach. Although the Bhagavatam’s “Earth” (disk- shaped Bhu-mandala) may look unrealistic, careful study shows that the Bhagavatam uses Bhu-mandala to represent at least four reasonable and consistent models: (1) a polar- projection map of the Earth globe, (2) a map of the solar system, (3) a topographical map of south-central Asia, and (4) a map of the celestial realm of the demigods."

- गगन-मरुद्-अग्नि-जल-मृण्-मयो महाभूत-गुण-युतः स्वस्थः । कक्षाभिर् आवृतोऽयं भ-पञ्जरान्तश् च भूगोलः ॥ "The sphere of the earth formed of space, gas, heat, liquid, solid thus having the properties of the 5 great bhuta-s stands by itself in the celestial sphere surrounded by the celestial orbits."
- मध्ये ऽयस्कान्तानां यथा स्थितो ऽयोगुडः ख-मध्यस्थः । तद्वद् अनाधारो ऽपि हि सर्वाधारो महीगोलः ॥ "Just as an iron ball when placed between magnets the earth-globe remains suspended in the midst of space without any support, while supporting all (that is on it)."
- लङ्का प्राग् यमकोटिः पश्चाद् रोमकम् अधश् च सिद्धपुरम् । मेरुः स्थित उत्तरतो दक्षिणतो दैत्य-निलयः स्यात् । "Lankā (which is close to the equator), to the east is Yamakoti, Romaka to the west, Siddhapura on the opposite side of Lankā, Meru is at the north pole and abode of the Asura-s at the South Pole."
- एते जल-स्थलस्था मेरुः स्थल-गो ऽसुरालयो जलगः । कु-परिधि-पादान्तरगा मन्यन्ते तिर्यग् अन्योऽन्यम् ॥ "(The first 4) are on separate continents separated by oceans, Meru is on land and the Asura abode in the midst of water. These (six places) are believed to be at a distance of 1/4th the earth's circumference from each other." 
- भूपरिधि-दलान्तरगाः के नृछाये यथा तथोर्ध्वम् अधः । सर्वेषम् उपरि नभस् तद् अधो भूर उपरि ते भूमेः ॥ "Those who are situated at have the Earth's circumference are above and below each other like the shadow of a man. Above all this is the atmosphere. Below that is the earth on top of which are the earthlings." 
- तरु-नग-नगर-सुर-नरैर् अयङ् केसरैर् इव समन्तात् । गोलः कादम्बो मधुकरीभिर् इव सर्वतः प्रचितः ॥ "This [earth] covered all over with forests, mountains, cities, gods and men is like the spherical kadamba flower with anthers and bees all around it."

## pRthUdaka-svAmI  864 CE
- He was a chaturvedin son of madhusUdana bhaTTa.
- "भ-पञ्जरः स्थिरः । भूर् एवावृत्यावृत्य प्रति-दैवसिकौ उदयास्तमयौ सम्पादयति नक्षत्र-ग्रहाणाम् । आचार्यार्यभटेन+अपि भू-भ्रमणम् अभ्युपगतम्: “प्राणेनैति कलां भूः ।"" - "The celestial sphere is stationary. Only the earth keeps rotating and rotating, once everyday, causing the rising and setting of the stars and planets. The earth's rotation had been accepted by professor Aryabhata: "the earth rotates by the angle of a kala in unit of time of a prāņa"".

## makkibhaTTa 1377AD
- Commented on Sripati's Siddhantasekhara.
- He agreed with AryabhaTTa.

## Vatasseri Parameshvara Nambudiri ( c. 1380–1460)
- He wrote goladIpikA.
- गोलाकारं मण्डलम् अर्कादीनां स्मृतं गणक-मुख्यैः । दर्पण-वृत्ताकारं दूरगतत्वात् प्रदृश्यते ऽस्माभिः ॥ - The orbs of the sun and the like are known to be spheres according to great mathematicians. The appear like circular mirrors to us on account of their great distance. 
- शशि-बिम्बे दर्पणवद् वृत्ते तस्यैक-देश-सित-लब्धिः । भनोः कर-सम्पाते व्यवधानाभावतो न संभवति ॥ २.४६-४७ - If the moon were like a plane circular mirror then only a part of it appearing lit by the rays of the sun falling on it is not possible because of the absence of obstruction.

## kamalAkara-bhaTTa 1600s
- Not the more famous kamalAkarabhaTTa who authored शूद्रकमलाकर. Son of nRsiMha-jyotirvid. Actually travelled to Tajikistan to observe their astronomy.
- भूगोलो जल-मग्नोऽस्ति जलाद बहिर् अपि स्थितः । तत्र+अधिको जलान्तः स्थो बहिः स्वल्पोऽस्ति गोलवित् ॥ १.१२४  "The earth-sphere is covered with water with some parts which are indeed above it. The greater part is underwater and the smaller part is above it. [thus) a geographer [knows)."

## appayya-dIxita 1540 CE, baTTatiri
- Appayadikşita refers in the following passages to Aryabhata and his theory regarding the earth's motion - स्वर्ग-पृथिव्योः परस्परम् उपजीव्योपजीवक-भावस्य तुल्यतया स्वर्गो न प्रतिष्ठा पृथिवी प्रतिष्ठेति व्यवस्थितोक्त्य्-अयोगात् । किं तु निश्चलत्वम् इह प्रतिष्ठा-शब्दार्थः । तत् तु ज्योतिश्-चक्रान्तर्गतत्वेन भ्रमति स्वर्गे नास्ति, अस्ति तु पृथिव्याम् - "पृथिवी प्रतिष्ठेति" श्रुत्यन्तरात् । आर्यभटाद्य्-अभिमत-भू-भ्रमणादि-वादानां श्रुति-न्याय-विरोधेन हेयत्वात्।"
- appayya vs bhaTTatiri argument about heliocentricism:
  - Bhattatiri asked whether moon is closer to earth or the stars? Obviously moon (Since it occludes the stars).
  - It is known that certain stars rise earlier than the moon the following day (which is actually due to the true motion of the moon). Bhattathiri’s argument is: How come a far away object can have shorter period? It is logical absurdity and appayya was summarily beaten.
  - Bhattathiri was a great astronomer. Not many know it- They just end with nArAyaNIyam and at most his paada saptati.

## nIlakaNTha-dIxita
- prime minister of tirumala nAyaka, grand-nephew of appayya.
- "भुमिर् भ्राम्यति बुद्ध एव मरुतः प्रत्यग् भ्रमोऽत्य्-अद्भुतो,  
  भ्राम्यन्त्य् एव सहाश्रयेण यदि वा, ज्योतींषि सर्वाण्य् अपि ।  
  आवर्त्यो ऽयम् अपाम् भ्रमः परिचिता, मूर्तिर् हरस्याष्टमी -   
  या साऽस्त्य् अप्पयदीक्षितो जयति सा, मुर्तिर निरस्तभ्रमा॥"
  - "Indeed it is known the earth rotates, the Marut-s [atmospheric winds] rotate in opposite direction most marvellously, thus are caused to rotate all the heavenly bodies as if along with the celestial globe. This rotation is the movement of the waters. The forms of Rudra are known to be eight of which Appaya Dīkşita shines as that form which is stationary (or: without delusion)."
  - This can be "a reflexive attempt at correcting Appayya's insistence on a geocentric, geostationary cosmology in commenting on a shrutivAkya".
