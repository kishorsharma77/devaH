The epoch of Kali Era adopted for All-India Nirayana Calendar is midnight (IST) of 17/18 February of 3102 B.C. or -3101 A.D. of Julian calendar and the length of its year is reckoned on the basis of true length of sidereal or nirayana year.
For calendric purposes, the All-India Nirayana Calendar has been deemed to have started from 5101 Kali Era year +++(2000 AD?)+++. The methodology for determining leap year of this calendar is given below:

## Month days
- Vaisakha 31 days starts 14 April.
- Indian Calendar ... Gregorian Calendar 
- Caitra 1 ... March 15 in a common year & March 16+++(?)+++ in a leap-year. 
- Vaisakha 1 April 14
- Jyaiştha 1 ... May 15
- Aşadha ... June 15
- Srāvana 1 ... July 16
- Bhadra August 16
- Āśvina 1 September 16 
- Kārtika 1 October 16
- Agrahāyana 1 November 15
- Pausa 1 December 15
- Māgha 1 January 14
- Phālguna 1 ... February 13 


## Leap years
If a Kali Era is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 4000, then that year is considered as a leap year. Accordingly Kali Era years like 5104, 5108, 5112....etc are leap years but 4000, 8000, 12000... etc. are not leap years. There are also additional leap years. If a Kali Era year becomes divisible by 150 then the subsequent year of that Kali Era year will be an additional leap year. Accordingly Kali Era years like 5101, 5251, 5401... etc. are additional leap years.
