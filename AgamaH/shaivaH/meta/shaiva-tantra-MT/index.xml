      <description>Very little is preserved of the ancestral tantric shaiva lineage prior to its split into the five fold path. An early formula of the lineage that survives is seen in the garuDa tantra termed hara tantram, which itself does not survive as a full text as far as I know.
The distinctive core used to make the oblation for rudra in the fire is thus:

      <description>As we argued earlier the kAlAmukhas were rather orthodox, even if electic, followers of the Astika path. Their intellectual prelidictions were rather clear, and they philosophical abilities are also strongly suggested from what material that survives of the shakti pariShad, mainly in the Kannada country, and the siMha parishad in the Andhra and Tamil country. Their Kashmirian precursors were also strongly intellectual brahmins (the kAshmira paNDitas of the inscriptions) who originally coexisted with their cousins who were proponents of other tantric schools like shrikula and trika.</description>

Diversity and syncretism in the bhairava or dakShiNa srotas
The bhairava-srotas of the shaiva mantramArga was clearly one of the most speciose branches of the shaiva-shAsana. From the ancestral bhairava-srotas base that itself most probably arose from the kApAlika-oriented streams of the underlying shaiva atimArga the system spawned several distinctive branches: 1) An early branch was the dakShiNashaiva stream centered around the worship of svachChanda bhairava; 2) the system of kapAlIsha bhairava mainly taught in the archaic brahma-yAmala (distinct from the later brahma yAmala of the drAviDa country).</description>

      <description>In the Hindu world view ritual and philosophy are intimately linked. From the substratum of the shrauta ritual the ancient upaniShads arise. From the matrix of the tantras the highest kaulika thought emerges. Only one who can fully internalize this organic connection between the ritual perform and philosophy, can truly grasp the language and thought of the ancient Hindu. While the veda and the mantra-tantra shAstra may appear superficially very distinct they are unified by the same underlying entwinement of ritual practice and philosophical contemplation.</description>

      <description>Modern historians have seen the vIrashaivas as an organic evolute of the kAlAmukhas. While their attachment to li~Nga worship, shiva devotion and monastic organization are indeed comparable, there are many differences. The vIrashaiva cult, while found by a brahmin basava, had a rather anti-brahminical streak. Firstly, it was vociferously critical of the varNAshrama dharma and secondly sought to replace brahminical rites with imitations. For example, they used the rudra gAyatrI in place of the savitA gAyatrI for the saMdhya rite.</description>

      <description>The siddhAnta tantrics receive their names as per a fixed procedure: After the student receives mantra dIkSha from the preceptor, s/he is taken to the central kumbha in which shiva has been invoked earlier. Then, the student casts flowers which s/he is holding in his hand on the kumbha. His name prefix is chosen based on a name or attribute of the pa~nchabrahma mUrti in whose direction the flowers fall. Top:IshAna, West: sadyojAta, East: tatpuruSha, South: aghora; North: vAmadeva.</description>

The netra tantra commented upon by the famous kShema-rAja, student of abhinava-gupta, is of some what later origin amongst the shaiva tantras. It is not listed as a primary text in any of the five srotas of the tantric shaiva mArga in support of this contention. However, it was definitely considered cannonical by the start of the syncretic trika period.</description>

The Shunga coins: The late Maurya and Shunga period has the square coins of the Ujjain series bearing the image of kumAra. They installed some idols of kumAra in Mathura (175-50 BC).
The Shakas: The Shaka king Ayalisha (Azilises-I) has kumAra on his coin. Another Indianized Shaka mentions construction of a well in the name of skanda. The exact date of this inscription is unclear: mentioned as year 201 in some era.</description>

I have yarned a lot on this topic from different angles: 1) The shaivas: the pAshupata-s
3) dvijas and non-dvijas in the shaiva cults 2) The kAlAmukhas-I 4) kAlAmukhas-II
But I was brought back to it because ST happened to introduce me to a confused brahmin woman who declared that her Dravidian guru had told her that the siddhanta shaivas had dispensed with the “brahminical strictures” and made their mata “more accessible” to all.</description>

      <description>I decided to put down some matters arising in the discourse with R during the winding train journey.
The following are listed as authoritative tantras by the great trika tantrics:
1) kAmika 2) kiraNa 3) niHshvAsa 4) pauShkara 5) raurava 6) svAyambhuva 7) pArameshvara.
These may be termed the proper shaivAgamas
(some of these contain important details concerning the pa~nchAkShari of mahAdeva, of which another aspirant had made some recent enquiries to me).</description>

These three states of the deva are stationed in the akShara puruSha maNDala. The five short vowels are the faces and the 7 long vowels are the limbs of the body. They are conjoined with the nasal bindu.</description>

      <description>The very word tantra conveys that deep meaning to the “knowers”. That secret power that resides in the ‘hR^idaya‘ of bhairava and is known as kaulinI. The anuttara of its own confers kaulika perfection. The tantra is like a science because it is reproducible in its real form. The sAdhaka on the true path first gets a glimpse of “kaulika existence” when he can grasp the the samvAda of manthAna bhairava and tripura bhairavI.</description>

      <description>One of the most enigmatic of the shaiva groups of India were the kAlAmukhas. Their origins and the rise to power are shrouded in mystery. An added mystery is their suddence disappearance despite their prominent presence in the mideaval period. I stood before a great shrine of The god once built by the kAlAmukhas in the city of my birth and wondered about their origins. They were described as kAlAmukhas after the practice of marking their foreheads with a black streak.</description>

An important, but neglected aspect of the history of India before the cataclysmic Islamic interruption, was the role played by the mantra-mArga siddhAnta shaiva-s in the unification of the country. We had earlier spoken of our historical clansman, the great varmashiva of vodAmayUtA, who converted to this lineage of shaiva-s and had considerable influence with the royal patron of his age. But this just one point in the broader scheme of things.</description>

      <description>It is clear from tirumantiram verses 337 onwards that tirumUlar was an extreme sectarian shaiva. He cites several elements of shaiva mythology, where the aim is plainly to show the supremacy of shiva over other gods. He also sees a sadashiva higher than rudra in his world view, which is typical of this stream of thought and the sectarian shAktas further go on to subsume the five brahma, viShNu, rudra, mahesha and sadAshiva as the 5 pretas forming the cot of the transfunctional shaktI.</description>

      <description>The rise of shaiva thought in the draviDa country was a milestone in the incorporation of motifs of Sankrit thought from North India. The Dravidian works of shaiva literature closely parallel their development in North Indian Sanskrit literature pointing to a pan-Indian explosion of Hindu thought that gradually displaced the competing heterodox ideas of the Jaina and Bauddha stream from the collective folk conciousness. Unfortunately, the Tamil shaiva and vaishNava literature is not studied as an integral companion to their Sanskrit precursors and counterparts because of the political perversion of Dravidian nationalism and Tamil chauvinism in the past century.</description>

The early evolution of the shaiva fold is a topic of tremendous interest (I am only grazing the surface with regards to a few points here. One may see some other notes on this topic elsewhere on this site). We obviously have no strong traces of its para-vedic elements. But there are several texts that pertain to the branching point of shaiva from within the old vedic tradition.</description>

      <description>The following is courtesy of Rajita, whom the deva-s have given me the fortune to know. I have only worked [partially] on akShara-shuddhi of the mantra readings and put it together here with due permission.
The kaTha dIkShita-s who were shrauta ritualists as well as well accomplished tantrics had a distinctive pradoShaM rite on the trayodashi before mahAshivarAtrI and that is described here. Interestingly they observed fast on trayodashi during the day time.</description>

      <description>mada-sAgara, tumburu and the 4 devI-s dAnavendra realized that if he could get hold of the amR^ita of the deva-s he would be victorious. For this he went over to the circle of mAtR^ikA-s headed by chakrakarAlinI and invoked them to fight on his side. He also got the anantavIra-s who had emanated from the 8 bhairavas starting from asitA~Nga to kapAla to fight on his side. As a result the mAtR^ikA’s and vIra-s attacked the deva-s and the great bhairava, and while they were fighting dAnavendra stole their soma.</description>
