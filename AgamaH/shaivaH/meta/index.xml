The Siddhānta is still very much dominant in TN. But yes, it did not spread much outside TN. Even Umāpati Śivācārya did not propagate it outside TN. The decline of the Siddhānta has two historical phases:
   It was once very dominant in Kāśmīra, Madhyapradeśa, Gauḍa &amp;amp; Utkala deśa-s. By 1000s-1100s, it was rapidly shrinking to the area of the southern states.    Post 1200s: We have evidence suggesting that the Siddhāntāgamas &amp;amp; Aṣṭaprakaraṇas (Siddhānta proper) were well known even in Karṇāṭaka though it was getting immensely diluted in Kērala.</description>
