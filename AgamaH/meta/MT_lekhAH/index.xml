      <description>The two tantric upaniShads, avyakta and nR^isiMha-tApini are clear in their pA~ncharAtra affinities. Yet the saMkhya origin mythology of the avyakta is a pretty remarkable piece that is worth considering, for it is a rather distinctive expression of earliest stages of the universe. While in general concepts is similar to the thoughts expressed in other pA~ncharatra sAMkhya origin mythologies, such as the lakShmi-tantra, it different in the details. Of course it does not go into the details of the ta~nmAtras and their ontology like the account in the viShNu purANa, but its clarification of the early events in just two paragraphs is useful.</description>

      <description>When did human rituals begin? As a ritualist and evolutionary explorer this question has naturally attracted my attention. My own contention is that the genetico-memetic complex of ritual probably goes back to our common ancestor with the African Great Apes or even beyond to the common ancestor of the Great Apes. In this context, the Bushmen of Africa are of particular interest because they are the earliest branching line of humans alive today.</description>

      <description>One thing many fellow traditional Hindus have found frustrating about me is my lack knowledge and lack of affinity for the advaita stream of vedanta, and more fundamentally me being a svatantra. My blasphemous views regarding vedas and their apauruSheyatva are also hardly appreciated in their midst. I am not shaken by their views because I am pretty firm in my convictions on these matters arising from ongoing study of the originals, and yAj~navalya always stands out as beacon.</description>

      <description>The shrIvidyArNava is an excellent tAntric manual that was used as textbook for mantra shAstra instruction amongst certain brahminical schools. It contains 2 halves called pUrva and uttara ardha-s of 18 chapters called shvAsas each. It runs into 1459 devanagari print pages to give an idea of its size. It is a digest for a wide range of material from ancient tantras that appear to be lost. One of these is the kukkuTeshvara tantra, whose prayogas are still remembered by several practioners even if only in fragments.</description>

      <description>The Wodeyar of Mysore, kR^iShNa rAja, prepared a compendium of Hindu iconography from diverse classical Hindu sources. This collation called the shrI-tattva-nidhI (STN) has become a useful standard for upAsaka-s in amongst educated Hindus, especially from Southern India. Sadly, the full text is not easily accessible these days. It is useful to examine the succinct descriptions of iconography that he provides in his text.
The STN is divided into 9 chapters:</description>

      <title>“Tantric” upaniShad-s and their role in Hindu thought</title>

      <description>The point of origin of the later sectarian upaniShads is unclear. It appears that the early shaiva-s and vaiShNava-s had begun the composing upaniShadic material in the latest phase of the vedic era. The oldest amongst these is the shaiva-leaning upaniShad- shvetAshvatara, which incorporates several verses from the shatarudriya of the kR^iShNa-yajurveda. The atharva-shiras and the nArAyaNa-valli seem to the next set of upaniShads composed by the shaivas and vaiShNavas respectively.</description>
