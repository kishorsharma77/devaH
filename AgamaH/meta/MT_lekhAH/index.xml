      <description>The shrIvidyArNava is an excellent tAntric manual that was used as textbook for mantra shAstra instruction amongst certain brahminical schools. It contains 2 halves called pUrva and uttara ardha-s of 18 chapters called shvAsas each. It runs into 1459 devanagari print pages to give an idea of its size. It is a digest for a wide range of material from ancient tantras that appear to be lost. One of these is the kukkuTeshvara tantra, whose prayogas are still remembered by several practioners even if only in fragments.</description>
