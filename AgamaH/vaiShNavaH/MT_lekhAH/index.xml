      <description>One of the most lucid expositions of the foundational philosophy of pA~ncharatra is seen in the lecture given by lakShmI to indra in the lakShmI-tantraM (chapter 4):
1) Originally lakShmI and viShNu are conjoined in an undifferentiated form termed the “pure space”. This combination of viShNu and shrI is termed the homogeneous state which cannot be discerned and with out any fluctuations in it.
2) From time to time a minute particle comprising of a 10^-18 viShNu-shrI continuum state differentiates into action.</description>

How did these mightiest mantras of viShNu come into being? Beyond pa~ncharAtra promulgated by the chitrashikaNDins are the tantras of viShNu made apparent by the shANDilyas. The root tantra of these is the glorious viShNu yAmala. From here stem the ugra viShNu, halAyudha, ugrachakra and other formulations. After bhairava had been quenched by the draught of viShNu’s blood he asked sadAshiva to narrate the glorious vidyAs of viShNu.</description>
