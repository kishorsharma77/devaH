      <description>In bR^ihatsamhita 60.19 varAhamihira states that sUrya should be worshipped by installing idols of his and they should be worshipped by specialized priests called magAchAryas. This is corroborated by the bhavishya purANa chapter 139 that narrates the following tale (a critical reconstruction of it):
kR^ishNa, the hero of the yadus married jAMbavati, the daughter of the bear-king jAmbavAn. Their son was the valiant sAmba. He went to the banks of the river chandrabhAga and constructed temple in the honor of sUrya.</description>

      <description>We had earlier compiled incomplete accounts of both the saura mata and its offshoots like the worship of revanta.
We initially wanted to work on the final part of the incomplete revanta essay dealing with the specific point of the evolution of shAstA from revanta and the relationship between their tantric prayogas. Then we realized we never put together the additional material from the various purANas on the core saura mata that we originally intended.</description>
