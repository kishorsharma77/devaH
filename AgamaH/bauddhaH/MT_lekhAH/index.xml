      <description>It is clear that the chInas have had contact with the Indians over a long period and have imbibed various forms of Hindu thought. It is also well-known that the bauddha influence on the chIna-s was profound from the early phase of the foreign expansion of the bauddha-mata. Especially, the emphasis on the desha-bhASha as against the deva-bhASha in the transmission of the early bauddha doctrine resulted in a profound change amongst the chIna-s, which corressponded to the shift from the peculiar literary chIna-bhAsha to the colloquial chIna-bhASha, with incorporation of indic terminology in translation.</description>
