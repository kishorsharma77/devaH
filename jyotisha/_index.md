- Sun is always at 0 deg latitude. It's longitude (determinable using background stars) is 0 deg (=0 RA) during march vernal equinox, 90 deg (= 6h RA) during summer solstice, 270 (= 18h RA) during winter solstice etc..
- Latitudes are parallel to each other, longitudes pass through the same two poles.

### Equatorial
- Equatorial Right ascension (RA)/ declination (dec) relative to spring/ vernal equinox point : [intro](https://lco.global/spacebook/equatorial-coordinate-system/).

Then the star will rise exactly at east. Krttikas on celestial equator around 2900BCE (two centuries before and after can be considered as acceptable)। \[[TW](https://twitter.com/agnimaan/status/984433779967082496)\]

## परसंस्कृतिभिस् तोलनम्
- Tropical
    - "Western astrology uses the so-called tropical zodiac in which 0 Aries is defined by the vernal point (the celestial point where the sun stands at the beginning of spring). The tropical zodiac is a division of the ecliptic into 12 equal-sized zodiac signs of 30° each. Astrologers call these signs after constellations that are found along the ecliptic, although they are actually independent of these constellations. Due to the precession of the equinox, the vernal point and tropical Aries move through all constellations along the ecliptic, staying for roughly 2160 years in each one of them. Currently, the beginning of tropical Aries is located in the constellation of Pisces." \[[SW](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773505)\]
    - "It was the Indian astronomy historian S. B. Dixit (also written Dikshit), who first proposed in 1896 that the zodiac should be oriented towards the star Spica (Citra in Sanskrti), in his important work History of Indian Astronomy (= Bharatiya Jyotih Shastra; bibliographical details further below). Dixit arrived at the conclusion that, given the prominence that Vedic religion gave to the cardinal points of the tropical year, the Indian calendar should be reformed and no longer be calculated relative to the sidereal, but to the tropical zodiac. " \[[SW](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc502931328)\]

- Sidereal
    - "There are also sidereal traditions of astrology, both a Hindu tradition and a western tradition, which derives itself from ancient Hellenistic and Babylonian astrology. They use a so-called sidereal zodiac, which consists of 12 equal-sized zodiac signs, too, but it is tied to some fixed reference point, i.e. usually some fixed star. These sidereal zodiac signs only roughly coincide with the sidereal zodiacal constellations, which are of variable size." \[[SW](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773505)\]
    - "Sidereal planetary positions are usually computed from tropical positions using the equation: sidereal\_position = tropical\_position – ayanamsha(t) , where ayanamsha is the difference between the two zodiacs at a given epoch." \[[SW](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773505)\]

    - gave several public lectures in Chennai to attempt to increase the awareness of Hindus on modern astronomy and the importance of first hand and meticulous observations
    - "discussed the importance of modern astronomy with the ācarya of the Sriperumbudur śrīvaiṣṇava maṭha and convinced him to adopt a modern astronomical almanac, "
    - "demonstrated to his Vedic ritualist friends, Venkateshvara Dikshita and Sundaresha Shrautin, that the astronomical tables of the traditional astronomers of Andhra and Dramiḍa were otiose and that they badly mis-predicted basic astronomical events which are central to Vaidika rituals"
    - "during the solar eclipse of August 18, 1868 RA was able to demonstrate his predictions: He got the eclipse time correct with an error of 12 seconds using calculations done by his hand while the traditional astronomers performed dismally with a whopping 24 minute error. This had a strong effect and many traditional Hindus now switched over to his side. He then demolished the most recalcitrant traditional astronomers in a sadas of brāhmaṇa-s of the Dramiḍa country. Seeing this the Śaṃkara maṭha sent out a circular stating that the Vedic ritualists Venkateshvara Dikshita and Sundaresha Shrautin were correct in adopting modern theory and techniques for their rituals. His efforts were paralleled by those of Ketkar in Maharashtra and Venkatakrishna Raya in Andhra to get the Hindus to use modern astronomical calculations."
