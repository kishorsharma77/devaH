- श्रीरमणशर्मा [वक्ति](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/swisseph/conversations/topics/6581) \- "the whole purpose of jyautisha is to know beforehand what will be observed or to compute later on what would have been observed as the Surya Siddhanta 2-14 says: tattadgativaśān nityam yathā \*dṛktulyatām\* grahāḥ / prayānti tat pravakṣyāmi sphuṭīkaraṇam ādarāt // 
  - People who blindly follow siddhAnta calculations without accounting for precession or season are violating the siddhAnta texts they supposedly revere!

## परसंस्कृतिभिस् तोलनम्
- Tropical
    - "Western astrology uses the so-called tropical zodiac in which 0 Aries is defined by the vernal point (the celestial point where the sun stands at the beginning of spring). The tropical zodiac is a division of the ecliptic into 12 equal-sized zodiac signs of 30° each. Astrologers call these signs after constellations that are found along the ecliptic, although they are actually independent of these constellations. Due to the precession of the equinox, the vernal point and tropical Aries move through all constellations along the ecliptic, staying for roughly 2160 years in each one of them. Currently, the beginning of tropical Aries is located in the constellation of Pisces." \[[SW](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773505)\]
    - "It was the Indian astronomy historian S. B. Dixit (also written Dikshit), who first proposed in 1896 that the zodiac should be oriented towards the star Spica (Citra in Sanskrti), in his important work History of Indian Astronomy (= Bharatiya Jyotih Shastra; bibliographical details further below). Dixit arrived at the conclusion that, given the prominence that Vedic religion gave to the cardinal points of the tropical year, the Indian calendar should be reformed and no longer be calculated relative to the sidereal, but to the tropical zodiac. " \[[SW](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc502931328)\]
- Sidereal
    - "There are also sidereal traditions of astrology, both a Hindu tradition and a western tradition, which derives itself from ancient Hellenistic and Babylonian astrology. They use a so-called sidereal zodiac, which consists of 12 equal-sized zodiac signs, too, but it is tied to some fixed reference point, i.e. usually some fixed star. These sidereal zodiac signs only roughly coincide with the sidereal zodiacal constellations, which are of variable size." \[[SW](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773505)\]
    - "Sidereal planetary positions are usually computed from tropical positions using the equation: sidereal\_position = tropical\_position – ayanamsha(t) , where ayanamsha is the difference between the two zodiacs at a given epoch." \[[SW](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773505)\]
