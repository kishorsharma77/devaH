      - {[MT04](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/12/06/the-snake-of-vishnu/)} - "ViShNu is a predominantly precessional deity. All his five early incarnations contain the precessional motifs that were uncovered by Santillana and von Dechend in The Hamlet’s Mill."
      - {[MT06](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/04/22/dandins-purvapithika-of-dasha-kumara-charitra/)} - "It is in this context that the great R^ikSha jAmbavant is described as circumambulating trivikrama as he took his great strides. This represents the new axis being established and the constellation of the Great Bear (represented as the bear jAmbavant) making a circle of the north celestial pole. Indeed viShNu himself is identified with the constellation of the shishumAra or Draco associated with the old north pole from earlier period of Aryan memory.  As the knowledge of precession is very subtle (even alluded in the opening of the maitrayaNi brAhmaNa fragment by shAkAyanya who was well aware of these matters) the third step of viShNu is secret and was only know to the great kavi-s." ... "In Indian architecture its depicted more directly on many occasions, but more subtly in the great iron pillar of the guptas. Before the iron pillar was uprooted by the Mohammedans and placed in the vicinity of their giant phallic signpost at Delhi, it graced the now derilict Hindu astronomical observatory at the viShNupAda-giri in the udayagiri complex. The iron pillar (as shown by Balasubramanian) was graced by a nakShatra-chakra on the top and was known as the viShNu dhvaja– depicting the great axis in front of the observatory located atop the hill. Thus, in the immortal pillar did chandragupta II vikramAditya, one of the greatest rulers of bhArata commemorate the step of viShNu and and world axis."

        - "assertion of the American indologist Whitney maintained to this date among Abrahamistic white indologists and their imitators: "The Hindus borrowed their nakShatra system from Mesopotamia and would probably have retained it in that form \[i.e. with kR^ittikA at the vernal equinox of 2300 BCE\] until the present day but for the revolution wrought in their science by Greek teaching." Clearly even within the vaidika period (including vedA~Nga jyotiSha) the Hindus had made multiple changes for precession not just at the time of varAhamihira after interactions with yavana-s." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/anatomy-and-heavens-in-the-boomorphic-universe/)\]
