## दृक्-तुल्यता-प्राधान्यम्
- While the practice has degenerated in the last hundred years or two, from my discussions with shrI RN Iyengar, it seems to have been the case that the jyotiSha mistakes in nirNaya grantha-s did not automatically hold sway over all vaidika-s (who were quite decentralized) - each hamlet or village had a local jyotiSha expert who would make observations by placing shanku-s and constructing requisite instruments.
- श्रीरमणशर्मा [वक्ति](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/swisseph/conversations/topics/6581) \- "the whole purpose of jyautisha is to know beforehand what will be observed or to compute later on what would have been observed as the Surya Siddhanta 2-14 says: tattadgativaśān nityam yathā \*dṛktulyatām\* grahāḥ / prayānti tat pravakṣyāmi sphuṭīkaraṇam ādarāt // 
  - People who blindly follow siddhAnta calculations without accounting for precession or season are violating the siddhAnta texts they supposedly revere!
