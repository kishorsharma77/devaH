- Sun is always at 0 deg latitude. It's longitude (determinable using background stars) is 0 deg (=0 RA) during march vernal equinox, 90 deg (= 6h RA) during summer solstice, 270 (= 18h RA) during winter solstice etc..
- Latitudes are parallel to each other, longitudes pass through the same two poles.
- The 0 deg and 180 deg longitude together form the equinotical colure.

## Equatorial

- Angle between the ecliptic and the celestial equator (they meet at equinotical points) is around 23 deg.
- At poles, celestial equator = horizon. No seasonally visible stars.
- During equinox day, sun appears to travel along the celestial equator.  Looking from the poles, sun will be at the horizon then. 
- Sun appears to go along other celestial lattitudes during other days. During northern solstice day, it will appear to travel along ~23 deg north celestial lattitude.

- Equatorial Right ascension (RA)/ declination (dec) relative to spring/ vernal equinox point and celestial poles : [intro](https://lco.global/spacebook/equatorial-coordinate-system/).
- The advantage of the equatorial coordinate system is that it expresses the position of a star or galaxy in a way that is independent of the observer's position on Earth.

### अस्य प्राचीनः प्रयोगः
-  shukla-yajurvedasya shatapathabrAhmaNe: "एता ह वै प्राच्यै दिशो न च्यवन्ते | सर्वाणि ह वा अन्यानि नक्षत्राणि प्राच्यै दिशश्च्यवन्ते तत्प्राच्यामेवास्यैतद्दिश्याहितौ भवतस्तस्मात्कृत्तिकास्वादधीत"। Proper East. 90deg from north. Possible only if the star is on the celestial equator. Then the star will rise exactly at east. Krttikas on celestial equator around 2900BCE (two centuries before and after can be considered as acceptable)। \[[TW](https://twitter.com/agnimaan/status/984433779967082496)\]
