## Intro
- ऋतवः स्वभावतः सौराः।
- राशिनिर्णये होरे च सौरराशिम् अवेक्षन्ते पाश्चात्याः। "Western astrology uses the so-called tropical zodiac in which 0 Aries is defined by the vernal point (the celestial point where the sun stands at the beginning of spring). The tropical zodiac is a division of the ecliptic into 12 equal-sized zodiac signs of 30° each. Astrologers call these signs after constellations that are found along the ecliptic, although they are actually independent of these constellations. Due to the precession of the equinox, the vernal point and tropical Aries move through all constellations along the ecliptic, staying for roughly 2160 years in each one of them. Currently, the beginning of tropical Aries is located in the constellation of Pisces." \[[SW](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773505)\]
- Assymetry in SB altar construction (and much later Ankor Wat design) represents division of year's seasons in 4000BC  ("Date of Solar orbit of Satapatha BrahmaNa" - Chandra Hari [अत्र](http://www.insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol35_1_2_KCHari.pdf)।)
- "It was the Indian astronomy historian S. B. Dixit (also written Dikshit), who first proposed in 1896 that the zodiac should be oriented towards the star Spica (Citra in Sanskrti), in his important work History of Indian Astronomy (= Bharatiya Jyotih Shastra; bibliographical details further below). Dixit arrived at the conclusion that, given the prominence that Vedic religion gave to the cardinal points of the tropical year, the Indian calendar should be reformed and no longer be calculated relative to the sidereal, but to the tropical zodiac.
