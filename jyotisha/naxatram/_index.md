## Intro to sidereal positioning
- "There are also sidereal traditions of astrology, both a Hindu tradition and a western tradition, which derives itself from ancient Hellenistic and Babylonian astrology. They use a so-called sidereal zodiac, which consists of 12 equal-sized zodiac signs, too, but it is tied to some fixed reference point, i.e. usually some fixed star. These sidereal zodiac signs only roughly coincide with the sidereal zodiacal constellations, which are of variable size." \[[SW](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773505)\]
- "Sidereal planetary positions are usually computed from tropical positions using the equation: sidereal\_position = tropical\_position – ayanamsha(t) , where ayanamsha is the difference between the two zodiacs at a given epoch." \[[SW](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc465773505)\]
