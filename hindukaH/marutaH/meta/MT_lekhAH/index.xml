[disclaimer: I tend to use Indicized spellings in most cases, which do not necessarily capture the Iranian pronunciation exactly. For my own Iranian studies I use the text of the avesta printed in an extended devanAgarI script which tends to capture the Iranian sound values well and also gives a sense of “script familiarity” while comparing it to the shruti].
For background: Iranian miscellany-1

      <description>परिचयः  maruts as &amp;quot;para-skanda&amp;quot; and other elements of their mythology इति मानसतरङ्गिणीकृल्लेखा काचित्। अत्र सौकर्यार्थं रक्षितम्।  Shift Many deities undergo drastic changes when they move across the veda-purANa transition: Some lose status: e.g. indra; others lose status and change character e.g. varuNa; others rise to exalted heights e.g. viShNu and rudra. But their mythology is still rooted in large part in their vedic antecedents. The marut-s are one of the most important deities of the veda-s, praised by all clans of R^iShi-s in various hymns and rituals.</description>

This note might be read as a continuation of the these two earlier ones:
1) The Aśvin-s and Rudra
2) The roots of Vaiṣṇavam: a view from the numerology of Vedic texts
In the Ṛgveda (RV), the Marut-s are seen associating with Viṣṇu on several occasions. This often occurs in the context of the epithets evaya or eṣa (meaning swift or ardent) being applied to them.</description>

      <description>Vedic sense of a~nji has some mystery to it. It has a clear connection to the marut-s.
For e.g. we have in the RV: ye pR^iShatIbhir R^iShTibhiH sAkaM vAshIbhir a~njibhiH | ajAyanta svabhAnavaH || It is normally translated as unguent. In fact has an IE pedigree with that word. However, it is mentioned here with the weapons of the marut-s R^iShTi (spear) and vAshI (battle pickaxe).
Here again it is mentioned with the battle axe, armor and gauntlets: ye a~njiShu ye vAshIShu svabhAnavaH srakShu rukmeShu khAdiShu | &amp;hellip; The a~nji of the marut-s is also notably said to be brilliant white in color.</description>
