The three-headed one, also known as the terrifying trishiro-bhairava, wandered around carefree in the great forests of himaparvatas. With one of his arms was holding the most beautiful madhumati of sweet smiles in an embrace around her gold-girt slender waist. In his other hands he held a mace, a trident, the blazing sudarshana, and a conch.</description>

The aponaptrIya is an important rite associated with the somayAga and is described in detail in the aitareya, the kaushItaki and chAgaleya brAhmaNas. The rite seems to be associated with the deities sarasvatI and apAM napAt and was probably instituted by kavaSha ailUsha, the priest of the pUru king kurushravaNa. Simply told, it is said that the other brAhmaNas, the madhymas questioned the legitimacy of kavaSha as a brahmin, calling him a cheat and one born through a dAsa [proto-Iranian?</description>

The fire worship of the Hindus is an ancient Indo-European trait that was clearly amplified in the Indo-Iranian branch. The primary fire priests of the Indo-Aryans are the bhR^igus and and a~Ngirasas who are remembered in the old vedic texts. The bhR^igus also known as atharvans are also remembered as the founders of the fire worship amongst the Iranians. The Iranian word for fire being Atar. One of the interesting trends noticed in the Hindu fire worship is personal association of each major Aryan clan with the invocation of fire, recaptitulating the way their founders did it via the AprI hymns.</description>

Before the animal sacrifice of the pashubandha the maitravaruNa priest utters the chant (RV 4.15.1-3):
****agnir hotA no adhvare vAjI san pari nIyate/ devo deveShu yaGNYiyaH //
agni, the hotar, being the booty bearing horse, is led around in our sacrifice; a deva to be worshipped amongst the devas.
a pari triviShTy adhvaraM yAty agnI rathIr iva / A deveShu prayo dadhat //
agni, like a car-warrior, goes around 3 times in our sacrifice, distributing amongst the devas the sacrificial offerings.</description>
